</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:—In reading this intellectual
volume of words I hopes that Mrs.
Public &amp; Husband will realize what I
am stabbing at. Science in kitchen, rugs,
vacuum cleaners, babies etc is what I wish
teach all homes. Can this be accomplish?
Answer is, Yes!! For housekeeping can get to
be a Science just like warfare and pulling teeth.</p>

<p>And in each of those letters scrambled together
in this Book I show you how like a Scientist
I behave; for Scientists learns big wisdom,
does they not, by manufacturing wicked smells,
explosions and unhappiness. I also learn knowledge
of housekeepery that way, and if occasional
folks expire dead from eating what I cook, they
should not get irritable. Science has its victims
as well as warfare.</p>

<p>Hon. Shakspeare, or some other great bookmaker,
say, “We learn by our mistakes.” If
such is case, then I have learned nearly everything
that can be assimilated about Gen. Housework.
I have followed considerable branches
of this kitchen intelligence throughout U.S.
America wherever I could find carfare. Therefore
I have swept all this wreckage together
in my brain and publicate them in this Book,
which is sort of letter of recommendation to
show how much I can accomplish when least
required.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span></p>

<p>Frequent Professors has asked that Question:
Why Do Servint Girls Be Servints? I have dishcovered
following reasons for it:</p>

<p>1—To accumulate $4 weekly until wealthy.</p>

<p>2—To drink gin secretly in refined homes.</p>

<p>3—To learn politeness from being snubbed by
Ladies.</p>

<p>4—To quit noisily.</p>

<p>Still more frequent Professors require: Why
is Reason for High Costly Living? Answer is,
Servints. If you ask any Lady in places from
which I have quit you will soonly find out. One
lady called me most expensive Servint in America
because I cost her $1302.33 for breakery of
crockery in one week of labor. I were considerable
proud of that record which are seldom
equalled, even by Swedish.</p>

<p>What are purpose of this Book? To teach
Ladies be more kind while abusing their help.
With very apologetic thumbs I acknowledge that
Hired Girls is not perfected like other modern
machinery. Too many waitresses wait too long
before obeying anybody. Too many nurses spoils
the children. Too many cooks spoils the broth.
Etc. Yet what could you expect for $6 weekly?
Not much. And you usually do not get it. This
are very labentable state of affairs, and I am
peculiar among Servint Girls because I never do
less than expected of me. I usually do more.
For instancely, if Hon. Boss Lady expect me to
break ½ her dishes, I break all. If she expect
me to burn up the roast, I burn down the house.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
Success in any line can be manufactured from
such industry.</p>

<p>House-ladies should continuously remember
that Servints are only human. Sometimes
slightly less. Nor should persons feel peev of
temperament because Cooks only stay shortly
when they call. Folks does not expec Doctors
and Undertakers to stay longtime when they
come to houses. No!! They got too much busy
duties elsewheres to linger considerable with one
customer, however much they enjoy it. Suchly
it is with Cooks. They give so much time they
can to each victim &amp; pass onwards. Then why
should they be followed with brickbatts &amp; regrets
when they depart for station? There is no
answer to this question.</p>

<p>During my promenades from jobs to jobs I
have visited considerable kitchens. Some folks
have promised to treat me like one of the family;
this sound deliciously sweet until I see how that
family behaves with itself. From such places I
escape nearly lifeless. In my profession I resemble
burglars—continually entering houses
without welcome and seldom quitting without
taking something with me. Sometimes I take
valuable experience, sometimes injury of eye
which are considerable precious for teach my
soul how to set in his place and act low down.</p>

Togo’s Thursdays Out</h2></div>

<p><i>To Editor Good Housekeeper Magazine who
should be found in every employment bureau</i></p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Dearest Sir</span>:—While working in servant-girlish
employment of Gen. Housework
I have endured considerable cruelties
with great durability. But when ladies
insists to pour kindness upon me, then the worm
twists from such brutality. For thus reason I
am now entirely disjointed from job of working
at home of Hon. Mrs. Heneretta Hoke &amp; Husband,
Nutt Center, N.J. I tell you this historical
event.</p>

<p>When I employ this Mrs. Hoke to be boss,
she say with Jane Addams expression, “Hon.
Abe Lincoln freed niggero slaves sometime of
yore; therefore Japanese servant must also be
considered human.”</p>

<p>“I do not expect such sweethearted treatment,”
I say for slight tear-drop.</p>

<p>“I am going to commence my beginning by
being generous to you,” she encroach. “You
may take Thursday afternoons out.”</p>

<p>“How far out can I take them?” are question
for me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

<p>“Plenty far,” she renounce, “but not so distant
he will not get back in time for breakfast Fryday
morning. I give you this Thursday p.m.  from
great philanthropy of soul, so you will be able
to work harder when you get back.”</p>

<p>“What amusements are proper for servant
on this bright holidate?” I ask to know.</p>

<p>“Sometimes one way, sometimes different,”
she pronounce. “Walking, setting down, quarreling,
flirtating, seeing emotion-picture show,
obtaining drunkenness, getting married or arrested—all
are good ways for servant on Thursday.”</p>

<p>I thank her from the stomack of my soul
and fill my brain with joy-thoughts about
that nice date of afternoon I should spend.
It were Monday when she say this. Each
day afterwards my gladness become pretty plenty
when I think what light amusement it should be.
I fill my mentality with plans for frivolity.
Maybe I should go to hear Rev. Dr. Soyanada
lecture on Mr. Ibsen. Or perhapsly I might
walk in Unnatural History Museum admiring
skeletons. These light joys seem pretty happy—but
O!—of suddenly I think something better.
I should write my cousin Nogi for meet me in
G. A. R. Cemetery where we could learn American
language by reading biographies on monuments.</p>

<p>Thursday morning arrive up. Such beauty of
day! Air was clear like alcohol, making blueness
of sky which removed blueness from heart. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
never observed better day for servants to see
cemeteries. At 11 I eloped to room for
make slight brush to shoes &amp; derby.</p>

<p>Lunch time arrive.</p>

<p>“Togo,” report Hon. Mrs. Hoke, poking unprepared
head into kitchen, “you will be unexpectedly
detained at home this afternoon; so
sorry. I shall give bridge-gamble for 48 friends
this and 6 additional must remain for dinner-eat.”</p>

<p>Door-slam was her next reply.</p>

<p>Mr. Editor, have you ever been retained in
kitchen, manufacturing lemonade-drunk for
ladies while Nature stand outside whistling for
you? Amidst such sorrows your fingers shuffle
their feet and your soul refuses. I attempt to
bake cake while enjoying these pains; but you
cannot make cake arise when your heart contains
no yeast.</p>

<p>All through brightness of afternoon bridge-gamble
continue while I poke forth chocolate.
At lateness of 11.22 p.m.  6 additional persons
depart off from dinner-eat. I go bed without
congratulation.</p>

<p>Next morning Hon. Mrs. report to kitchen
with shameface.</p>

<p>“So careless, I forgot Thursday!” she guggle.</p>

<p>“Could you not forget Monday or Wednesday
next time?” I acknowledge.</p>

<p>“When Thursday comes again, remind me it
is here,” she snuggest while tucking her hairs.</p>

<p>So I again enslave myself with fidelity for 6½<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
complete days. This Thursday, I think so, me &amp;
Nogi should see that delicious cemetery while
brightness of weather was there. Once more I
write Nogi, “Come meet me at kitchen, so we
sure find each other.” He reply back, “Will do.”</p>

<p>Next Thursday come up. More sunshininess
of thermometer I never saw. On such days birds
gets headaches from too much song. So I was
prepare to elope away for slight vacation. By
early date of breakfast I encroach up to Mrs.
Boss and reply with butler voice, “Thursday
have arrive!”</p>

<p>“So glad you remind me—so he has!” she
gosp. “If you had not speak I would forgot—Daughters
of Samantha Stitching Society meet
here this p.m.  You must assist with salad-eat
for 41.”</p>

<p>“Are this not my outside day?” I repeat for
slight peev of tone.</p>

<p>“Be less impertinent in your impudence,” she
snagger while walking.</p>

<p>I remain where was that afternoon. Yet my
soul became so sogged he nearly dropped out.
At 2 p.m.  while I was chopping up detestable
chicken for salad-feed, my Cousin Nogi make
smiling knock-knock to kitchen door.</p>

<p>“When shall you get out?” he require with
fashionable derby.</p>

<p>“I am hopelessly sentenced for life,” I reply
spirally. “Set down in chairs and enjoy my
imprisonment.”</p>

<p>Ring-door occur so I must lay aside my apron<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
and other sorrows while opening knob for assorted
fat ladies. When I go back to kitchen
and commence explaining indignation in Japanese
to Cousin Nogi, then Mrs. Hoke poke her
features in door.</p>

<p>“Who that?” she require hashly, making
points to Nogi.</p>

<p>“My affectionate cousin Nogi,” I corrode.</p>

<p>“You are not permitted to amuse cousins
while working,” she snib. “Howeverly, Nogi
may remain if he help pass salad to Daughters
of Samantha.”</p>

<p>Loudly crash heard when Nogi was escaping
through window.</p>

<p>Mr. Editor, Thursday Out are like any other
form of love. If you never had it you never
miss it. I had 2 Thursdays removed from me
and was getting accustomed to do without.</p>

<p>When another Thursday arrive up all Nature
look cross &amp; aggravated. Extreme cyclones begin
blowing away Kansas; trees threw down, huj
landslides of snow fell from heaven while wet
rain also was there to make puddles amidst ice.</p>

<p>Hon. Mrs. Heneretta Hoke arrive in kitchen
with her face filled up from the sunshine which
was not in sky.</p>

<p>“Togo,” she say so, making charity expression
of mouth, “you have been earnestly faithful
Japanese in bake, stew, and dish-wash.”</p>

<p>“I confess it.” This from me.</p>

<p>“Therefore I shall reward it,” she sympathize
while pointing to outdoors where nature were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
feeling seasick while blowing down hen-shed.
“I give you your Thursday Out.”</p>

<p>“I bid you merry no thanks!” I say it. “If
convenient, I shall take my outing inside where
there is less pneumonia.”</p>

<p>“O!” she defy with steam voice. “You dishobey
my orders?”</p>

<p>“If convenient,” I snagger, “I prefer my picnic
in my bedroom where there is only one leak.”</p>

<p>“Shall not do!” she howell. “Your lung require
fresh air Thursday.”</p>

<p>“My lung feel plenty fresh already,” I insure.</p>

<p>“O boneless Japanese!” she retork. “Why
should I be continuously thoughtful for your
convenience? Why should I treat you gently like
a horse when you stand there and kick my kindness
back in my face?”</p>

<p>Bang door. She popp away.</p>

<p>When dishes was entirely washed off I retire
upwards to my room with my mind full of
vacation. This department where I slept was
neat room for Japanese, but too small for Swedes.
What should I do with this enclosed Thursday?
Sleep, perhapsly, and enjoy a few nightmares by
daylight? This seem too inappropriate. What
then should I?</p>

<p>I set on bed opposite bursted portrait of Hon.
Geo. W. Washington while watching drop-drip
of rain falling into wash-bowl. Pretty soonly I
uprose and lock door.</p>

<p>How should I be amused? Then, of suddenly,
I think it. Music! That are considered most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
fashionable indoor exercise for jaded fatigue.
So I open up trunk and got out following implements:</p>

<ul>
<li>
1 Japanese banjo of whang-string variety.</li>
<li>5 complete cigars of Philippine factory.</li>
<li>1 music entitled “Jolly Widow Wedding March.”</li>
<li>1 umbrella of American nationality.</li>
</ul>

<p>I tie umbrella to bed, so keep off drop-drip. I
arrange myself under this water-shed, light cigar
in teeth, put banjo in knuckles, retain music on
knee. Then I commence beginning. Japanese
banjos, Mr. Editor, refuse to wear American
tunes unless forced to do so; but by practical
continuation of pick-pick on strings I can become
quite Mozart. I spent 2½ hours at this musical
sympathy, filling small room with more sounds
than it could contain and almost becoming tuneful,
when—O startle!—knock-knock rapped at
door.</p>

<p>“Come inwards!” I holla.</p>

<p>“Can’t do, and be pretty quick about it!”
glub basso voice of Hon. Mr. Hoke, making rattles
from locked knob. “Please unlock door so
I can drag you out.”</p>

<p>I oblige politely by unlatching that locker.
Hon. Hoke rosh inwards and stand sky-scraping
over me like bulldogs scaring mice.</p>

<p>“Why you mean?” he thonder. “Why you
so reptilian in depravity when kind Mrs. Wife
are so angel-handed? Are she not entirely generous?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<p>“She are quite Carnegie,” I pronounce humbly.</p>

<p>“Did she not give you my shoes last week?”</p>

<p>“She do. I am saving them to give to some
tramp who like ventilated soles,” I oblate.</p>

<p>“What are more ungrateful than ingratitude?”
he hoop. “And now this sweetish lady
offer you Thursday which you refuse. Why
so?”</p>

<p>I point out of window where weather was
there shooting lightning into churches while
thunder cursed with entreme bellus.</p>

<p>“I do not like this Thursday,” I renig. “It is
damaged.”</p>

<p>“You shall be included among the wreckage!”
he nash while compelling me downstair. And
next I stood alonesome in the midst of Thursday
which was quite drowned.</p>

Togo’s Moving Day</h2></div>


<p><i>To Editor Good Housekeeper Magazine, who
are still there, I hopes,</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:—Kindly to please notice my
detachment from employ of Hon. Mrs.
&amp; Mr. Anna G. Sulkz, Cornstable, N. J.
I shall tell you how they carelussly came to
remove their home without including me among
furniture.</p>

<p>One morning a.m. Hon. Mrs. arrive to
kitchen and observe me singing Japanese opera
amid dish-pans.</p>

<p>“Togo,” she say it, “date of Maytime will
soonly arrive up. May Day are come when
nervus prostration are enjoyed by all Homes
which must travel for their health.”</p>

<p>“I should like learn this education,” I say it.</p>

<p>“You shall,” she pronounce. “Kindly to begin
at oncely. Firstly you may rave through
house tearing all pictures down and all carpets
up. We must move on Wednesday before our
lease stops doing so.”</p>

<p>“I shall obey with faithful mania,” are promus
from me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span></p>

<p>So I do so to any extent. I seek forth with
tack hammer and am so earnest from labor that
entire residence look quite cyclone. Too bad
important cow portrait hanging over piano were
crushed by falling on that mahogany music!
Also sorry to observe so much jugs, china, and
ancestors bursted by striking me while I worked!
But what you expect? Home are like any other
ship. It would not be wrecked if it would remain
motionless.</p>

<p>But Hon. Mrs. Sulkz would not agree to this
wisdoms. When plaster cast of Mr. Dante,
famous inferno, fell over and stroked me on forehead
with his sharp nose, Hon. Mrs. make loudy
ouch.</p>

<p>“Awful!” she yellup. “Why must everything
break what strikes you?”</p>

<p>“I am grieved.” This from me. “If that
poet gentleman had less soft head it would not
explode when striking mine.”</p>

<p>“It were an artistic bust,” she narrate while
weeping.</p>

<p>“I notice this,” I reprobate while sweeping up
small plaster fraxures from that great poetry.—And
so onwards.</p>

<p>When Hon. Sulkz, important gentleman of
Senator Penrose resemblance, retire homewards
that night, he look round with anxious thumbs.</p>

<p>“I wish women could vote,” he exaggerate,
“because then they would get less time for housekeeping
and home would be left comfortable once
in a whiles.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>

<p>Hon. Mrs. make pepper answer to this reply,
but I were too busy dragging carpet downstairs
by his ears.</p>

<p>At lastly morning of May date arrive. I
awoke and called me early, wishing to think
Tennyson poem, but could not do because rain
ensued as usual and Italian-speaking shovels was
digging gas-hole in street amidst intense odor
of smell.</p>

<p>I hear noise of considerable “Whoa!” befront
of house. Look see! Three swollen
wagons resembling circus was there while 3
drivers, assisted by enlarged Irish, spoke language
to horses wearing overalls.</p>

<p>I rosh downwards to open door and all Moving
Vanners rosh inwards intending to make jiu-jitsu
with furniture.</p>

<p>“O please!” collapse Hon. Mrs. while them 6
Vanners looked cruelty at piano while unrolling
their giant muscles. “O please be gentle with
my home!”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Lady,” say Hon. Boss Mover, making
chawtobacco, “strong men are always kindest.”
With such dictation he embrace Hon. Piano with
terrible Turkish elbows and knock off several legs
by removing door-knob while brushing too close.
Assisted by considerable Irish, Hon. Piano make
crash-bang music by stumbling into Van.</p>

<p>“How could you treat music so carelussly?”
chock Hon. Mrs. ringing her hands.</p>

<p>“One cannot be a Sandow and a Paderewski
at same moment,” snuggest Hon. Boss Vanner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
while performing slides with bed furniture.</p>

<p>Pretty soonly all that Home was ejected outward
into street. Ancestors, coal-scuttles, landscapes,
dictionary, dust-pan, etc. all waltzed down
stairway on top of that great muscle. When
Hon. Vanner drop bureau which crack in 2 he
say to Hon. Mrs. Sulkz, with chivalry expression,
“I call you to witness; this goods is damaged.”
And so onwards.</p>

<p>Pretty soonly, when that Home were completely
tied down in wagons, Hon. Mrs. arise
upwards from her nervus prostration and say
so to me, “Togo, can your brain do some intellect?”</p>

<p>“I shall be entirely brilliant, if brain is not,”
I promus.</p>

<p>“Well, if so,” she snagger, “I wish you would
ride on front wagon with Chief Housebreaker
and tell his brainless mind the number of new
house where it should go.”</p>

<p>“Where shall it be?” I inquest.</p>

<p>“Remember this number exactly—125 North
Orange Street. Can your memory assimilate
it?”</p>

<p>“Doggishly!” I insure.</p>

<p>“Remember—125!!” she holla while Hon.
Vanload chuckle off.</p>

<p>This job of bossing boss make me entirely enlarged
in my sensations which feel like German
army. To think of! Small-down Japanese like
me setting there in frontwheel seat dictating orders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
to gigantic Irish! This show how brains
is more muscular than muscle.</p>

<p>Pretty soonly we arrive up to home entitled
Number 125. O such landscape of expensive
house! Front lawn extending on all sides, considerable
pompus windows, goddesses in iron
nightgowns standing near fountains, and front
door of considerable brass resembling Senators.
Joy inflamed my ears. How pleasure I feel to
know that Hon. Mr. Sulkz had increased his
salary so much he could afford to move into
house like a library.</p>

<p>While thinking this intelligence I stood forth
and command all those enlarged Vanners like
Napoleon moving into France. Firstly we go
to front door of new home for open him so
furniture get in. How strange! Hon. Key seem
disabled to unlock it. Howeverly much we twist
and fubble, it make no impression on that brassy
opening.</p>

<p>“You have got wrong key,” say Chief Mover.
“But not be dishcouraged. I was once a burglar.
Therefore I can deceive that lock into opening
himself.”</p>

<p>With talented thumbs and several pocket-knife
he stroggled &amp; ranched until—O suddenly!—Hon.
Door click apart and there we stood in
grandy hall resembling theaters.</p>

<p>But what I see there? Surprise! That home
we entered were entirely filled with furniture of
boastful appearance. Sofas, statues &amp; gilty upholstery
stood everywhere looking natural.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span></p>

<p>“Last family have been too sluggish to move
out in time,” glub Hon. Vanner. “Shall we
throw out this proud furniture and wedge ours
in?”</p>

<p>“Not sure,” I renig dubfully. “So many
sideboards &amp; pianos might be too heavy to throw
very far. Perhapsly they are new instalment
furniture bought by Hon. Sulkz to fill up.”</p>

<p>“Gentlemen with so much duplicate tables
should lead double lives,” grubble Hon. Boss
Teamer. “Shall we move inwards?”</p>

<p>“With immediate quickness!” I signify, making
Admiral Dewey eyebrows.</p>

<p>So all Moving Vanners do so with immediate
strength. Sooner than before all that Sulkz
home was walking into midst of grandeur which
look quite snobbish to see so many plain chair
&amp; table piled up in midst of that Czar of Russia
parlor. No room was for another piano, yet we
pile him next. Dining-room were too much
crowd for second table, yet we set 2 on top
of each other. Same thing must be did with
beds, stoves, and wash-tubs.</p>

<p>When all this jobs were completely finished,
that house look like a judge after Republican
banquets—entirely grand, yet too filled to feel
comfortable.</p>

<p>However! When all those Vanners say “Gid-dap!”
and drove away in Gen. Direction of more
beer, I sat alonesome in house. 4 hours I await
idly doing nothing. What had occurred to kill
all Sulkz family that they do not come to reside
in this new palace? I was confused. Night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
time approach up. I could hear ghosts creaking
under piano, so I lit $10000 chandelier in dining-room
and ate crackers while pretending I were
King of Portugeese expecting revolution.</p>

<p>Silence was interrupted by noise. What was?
I heard many footprints walking into house—and
while it was too soon to hide, 2 realestaters,
6 police, Mrs. Sulkz, Mr. Sulkz, child &amp; dog
walk inwards.</p>

<p>“How you get in here?” howell Hon. Mrs.
with voice.</p>

<p>“I move in,” I narrate calmly. “This are
number you told.”</p>

<p>“It are right number but wrong house,” she
snuggest. “I told you North Orange Street.
This are South Orange Street.”</p>

<p>“Would that make some importance?” I ask
out.</p>

<p>“Mentality of a mice!” she aggravate. “Do
you not know difference between North and
South?”</p>

<p>“There are no difference,” I explan with
Abe Lincoln expression. “That were settled by
civil war.”</p>

<p>But before I could complete finishing my talk,
more civil war elapsed while Hon. Sulkz, police,
real-estate, child &amp; dog poke me through mixed
furniture while I eloped away like an old-fashioned
egg escaping from Dr. Ostler.</p>

<small>Togo Runs a Furnace</small></h2></div>


<p><i>To Editor Good Housekeeper Magazine who
are cheaper than coal, because he warms many
homes, price 15c.</i></p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:—Most recent job of employment
I was impeached from was home of
Mrs. and Mr. J. W. Humburg, Pondside,
N.J. Perhapsly you can tell me why, because I
am disabled to understand the customary habits
of some households.</p>

<p>Just a few days of yore I apply there in extreme
coldness of snow. This Hon. Mrs. Humburg,
dark hairs lady of muscular expression,
approach to kitchen and observe me.</p>

<p>“You are a cook?” she ask it.</p>

<p>“Yes are!” I say it.</p>

<p>“Then you will be expected to feed the furnace
while doing so,” she negotiate harshly.</p>

<p>“Must I be an engineer because I am a hired
girl?” I requesh.</p>

<p>“I guess supposedly,” renig Hon. Mrs., while
leading me to inferno of down-cellar where I was
introduced to Hon. Furnace. This iron animal,
Mr. Editor, lives like a very homely hermit in
middle of low darkness. He set there in nest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
of ashes, with tin snakes growing from his forehead
like zinc octopus. His teeth was full of
blazes and he would of made a nice idol for
Japanese to worship when feeling old-fashioned.
I could not love his face which seem too hungry
when open and too satisfied when closed.</p>

<p>“We never permit him to go out in winter,”
narrate Hon. Mrs.</p>

<p>“I shall watch see he do not escape,” I
promus with Wm. Jerome eyebrows.</p>

<p>Annexed to Hon. Furnace were a slight clock
with one finger going around like taxicabs.
“This are the steam gag,” explan Hon. Mrs.
“He are now pointing 23.”</p>

<p>“Do that tell age of Hon. Furnace?” I require
educationally.</p>

<p>“No, not!” she snagger. “That indikate the
number lbs. steam in boiler. You must be careful
about that. If Hon. Steam Gag jump above
25 lbs. that will mean Hon. Furnace have got
too much steam on his brain and might blow up
with Harry Thaw noise. When Hon. Steam
Gag get too ambitious, Oh, cool Hon. Furnace
with immediate quickness before explode up!”</p>

<p>“A Samurai janitor fears no steam!” I reject
proudishly, while folding my elbows over
coal shovel.</p>

<p>Mr. Editor, I did not stoke long in this situation
of work, but I make very pleasant impression
of it. Although I enjoy thumb-scorch, ash-eye,
and janitorial pain of spine, yet I commence
to love Hon. Furnace for his characteristic. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
begin to dishcover he are like Hon. Beethoven,
famus piano-player—he got red-hot soul inside
his homely face. It were pleasant to watch him
eat $8 worth very hard coal and purr from sweet
digestion. It are nice to be healthy. He seem to
contain no meanness. When I close his mouth
with shovel he forgive that impoliteness. He
love to have me comb his ashes with poker.</p>

<p>Pretty soonly, while doing this, I begin to feel
like engineers running <i>Lusitania</i>. I decorate my
complexion with smudges and imagine how 1000
Newport passengers was on upstairs deck congratulating
my intelligence. While thinking
thusly I poke more coal into inflamed mouth of
Hon. Furnace. Yet I keep my scientific eyesight
on Hon. Steam Gag for see he did not over-jump
25 lbs., thusly causing mania to explode.</p>

<p>This engineerish work seem so heroic that I
grew quite peev about merely house-maidenly
work. Yet I was hired to do. So I perform
them with disgust.</p>

<p>While I was upstairs doing bed-make exercise,
Hon. Mrs. incroach with sharpness of face
peculiar to swords.</p>

<p>“I am quite aquainted with Hon. Furnace,”
I say for happy smiling.</p>

<p>“I notice it,” she degrade,“by the thumb-tracks
you leave on bed-spread.”</p>

<p>“If you would burn white coal, maybe I would
match your delicate home more nicely,” I snuggest.</p>

<p>She reply by not doing so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span></p>

<p>Hon. Furnace seem more depressed that afternoon
p. m., so I sit beside him to shovel nourishment.
Hon. Steam Gag say 14, which are very
sick temperature. Hon. Furnace look dull-eye
like fish, and more I coaled him the less he het.
I feed him slight soap-box for light foods, and
by 4:11 he smile more pleasanter and commence
eating coal. At 5:12 Hon. Steam Gag awoke
up to taxicab work.</p>

<p>Thusly I left him and go to kitchen for make
food for rest of family. But my soul would
not get into that kitchen work, Mr. Editor. It
were similar to a janitor attempting to be a chef.
It might be done, but can it? I almost nearly
put shovelful of coal in apple-pie, I was thinking
so hard about what would tempt appetite of
furnaces.</p>

<p>Howeverly, I finished fashionable foods for
that Humburg family to eat, to include considerable
potatus and canned corn. Hon. Mrs.
who went to Trenton for slight shop-buy, arrive
back at 6:34 attached to her Husband. I observe
that gentleman through door-hinge and notice
his dishagreeable Wall Street appearance. He
look entirely bear-market. First thing he do
when approaching inside was to sneeze while
walking to Hon. Radiator and touching him
with diamond fingers.</p>

<p>“Huh!” This from him. “Have you employed
Hon. Doc Cook for janitor?”</p>

<p>“Why so?” This from Hon. Mrs.</p>

<p>“Because he makes North Poles wherever he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
goes,” snig Hon. Mr. I could not assimilate this
compliment which might be otherwise.</p>

<p>I brought in dinner-food on tray and set him
to table. When Hon. Mr. took chair he looked
to me with serious eyesight.</p>

<p>“That are nice-looking niggero boy you employ,”
he snuggest to Hon. Mrs.</p>

<p>“He are not niggero,” she devolve. “He
got that complexion from being attentive to
furnace.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” he snagger. “If he would put more
coal in Hon. Furnace and less on that face, perhapsly
I should feel less iced.”</p>

<p>I could not chide that denaturized man, yet
I thought so.</p>

<p>After dinner-eat he approach to kitchen and
say: “Togo,” he say with doggish voice, “furnaces
are made for heats. Otherwisely we would
use ice-boxes, which is just as handsome. Any
cook who cannot feed my furnace should be
banished for cruelty.”</p>

<p>“I understand this knowledge,” I report
chivalrously.</p>

<p>“Did you permit Hon. Furnace to go out?”</p>

<p>“Ah, no, not I did!” This I say. “I watch
him entire day and give you my truthful insurance
he did not leave that cellar.”</p>

<p>“Tonight you must compel him to heat, no
matter how desperado you act,” he snarrel, departing
off with bang-slam.</p>

<p>At hearing such adjectives, angry rages filled
my hair with scorn. What is so ungrateful as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
ingratitude? Nothing!! Had I not sat by sick-bed
of Hon. Furnace, feeding him what stumach
would hold? Yes! And yet this crude gentleman
reproach my firemanship with coolness.</p>

<p>Nextly I become determined. I would compel
that heater to a hotter thermometer if I cooked
my soul doing so, I declare!</p>

<p>So I ascend down to cellar. Hon. Furnace
was still there doing the same. I shook him
with considerable peev, but he merely answered
by winking his dull coals. Hon. Steam Gag say
18 and act like he was intending to faint away.
I have read in novel-book about bravery of engineer
who save his ship by burning it up for
steam. I shall do similar!</p>

<p>I burst up kitchen table, which should burn
nice because covered with happy grease. Hon.
Furnace love such foods and eat him with loudly
roar. Hon. Steam Gag jump forwards to 19.
Afterwards I poke in oilcloth which blaze resembling
July 4 and smell more so. At this sight
Hon. Steam Gag leap onward to 21 and that cave
where Furnace lived become quite sun-stroke.
And when I fetch forth excelsior-shave quenched
with kerosene, I never observed Hon. Furnace
chew more satisfaction. Coal I added in hodd—when—Oh,
look!!</p>

<p>Hon. Steam Gag had arrived at 27 and was
pointing his reckless finger further up! This
could not happen!!! I remember how Hon. Mrs.
had cautiously warned me that Hon. Furnace
would get steamed brain and explode from dementia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
if Hon. Gag surpass 25 lbs. Yet there
he was approaching 30 with mean taxi-click!</p>

<p>What should heroes do with such circumstances?
I thought lightning. Too much fire
make too much steam, too much steam make
blow-off. Therefore fire must quit at oncely.
With rapid coal-scuttle I make outrush to kitchen
sink where I fill him with water and make back-rush
to cellar. I open mouth of Hon. Furnace,
and embracing my elbows, throw water with
awful strength. What did that cruel furnace
reply then?</p>

<p>WHOOSH!!!***</p>

<p>Out-jump of steam, cooked coal &amp; atmosphere
suppress me backwards with such rapidity that
I hurricaned through 2 doors and 1 window,
arriving in outside snow-bank on the seat of my
stumach.</p>

<p>“What deed have you done now?” scram
Hon. Mrs. from topside porch.</p>

<p>“Your furnace just discharged me,” I flop
back disgustly.</p>

<p>“I congratulate him,” she narrate. Then she
make earnest close-down to window, so there
I sat surrounded by frost.</p>

<p>Hoping you are the same,</p>

<p>During breakfast-table last Fryday Hon. Mr,
Spiggott look uply from Pittsbug news-reading
and say with voice, “Mrs. and Mr. Wm. H. Axweilder
shall be here tomorrow p.m. for slight
weak-end visitation.”</p>

<p>“They are both entirely unwelcome, I am
sure,” she snob.</p>

<p>“If we merely asked people we liked there
would be no hospitality,” he rake off. “We must
enjoy Hon. Axweilder’s company because of
his great wealth. If we are sufficiently delightful
to him maybe he will permit me to cheat him
in business. You will love his conversational
talk. For so dull a man he have a most penetrating
mind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span></p>

<p>“He <i>must</i> have to bore me so deep,” she
snagger. “I like his wife less than equally.”</p>

<p>So that day she enslave me for hard housework,
so all shall be delightful for this disgusting
visit. All day I do considerable proud bed-make
with swollen quilts of mushy silk appearance.
At lastly tomorrow p.m. arrive when
Hon. Mrs. approach, up to me and say with commutor
language:</p>

<p>“Togo,” she say it, “at toot of 2.22 train
Mrs. &amp; Mr. Axweilder will arrive in custody of
Hon. Husband. Kindly to hitch down Sarah,
the horse, to fashionable bug-wagon and elope
to depot with coachman expression.”</p>

<p>I go forthly to horse-garage where Hon.
Sarah stood eating his oat. So I hitched it and
made immediate race-course to depot where I
stood proudly clutching harness with grand
thumbs resembling Newport.</p>

<p>Toot-toot of 2.22! Three human personalities
eloped forthly from Pullmanly train. One
were Hon. Spiggott appearing full of courteous
peev. Another was one enlarged gentleman of
Republican expression. Another were a very
stretched lady whose nose contained great snobbery
amidst eyeglass.</p>

<p>“It are such pleasant change from our usual
wealth to be trotting behind mild horseback instead
of whizzing as usual in expensive ottomobiles,”
she snuggest sweetishly as we jogg
off.</p>

<p>“We prefer this style of locomobile because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
of its health,” growell Hon. Spiggott. Yet he
attemp to appear hospital.</p>

<p>At hallway of home Hon. Mrs. Spiggott were
enwaiting with face containing smiles. By the
cordial of her behavior you would think she was
glad. “I am so hilarious to see you including
your delicious husband!” she holla with soprano.
Kissing enjoyed.</p>

<p>“We shall have such unaccustomed pleasure
in these simple surroundings!” notate Mrs. Axweilder.</p>

<p>Mrs. Spiggott replied by looking iced with her
eyes.</p>

<p>“I am glad you have came on such an amiable
day for a golluf game!” deplore Hon. Spiggott
putting on sporty cap.</p>

<p>“Yes. It are going to rain,” say Hon. Axweilder
with slump voice.</p>

<p>“That will make it seem more Scottish,” say
Boss man cheerly.</p>

<p>“On what vacant lot have you room to play
golluf in such a neighborhood?” require Hon.
Ax while they depart off looking dangerous with
clubs.</p>

<p>“This evening,” Mrs. Spiggott explain to Mrs.
Axweilder, “we are determined to give you
dinner-party to include Mrs. &amp; Mr. Washington
Whack, very charmed people next door.”</p>

<p>“Are they related to the Whacks of Tuxedo?”
Mrs. Ax cut up.</p>

<p>“I are not acquainted with their geography,”
glub Mrs. Boss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span></p>

<p>“Unless from Tuxedo they cannot live,” describe
other lady.</p>

<p>Mrs. Spiggott reply by thinking unpleasantly.</p>

<p>“Would you not enjoy slight driveway around
neighborhood for observe country and fresh
air?” she require at lastly, as soonly as her voice
ceased freezing.</p>

<p>“I am always fascinated to see how the other
½ lives,” Mrs. Axweilder shoot up.</p>

<p>So I again hitch down Sarah, the horse, and
forthly we trotted. While we elope past sweet
gardens &amp; landscapes that visitor continue
gawsping: “Quaint! How comfort people can
be for small salaries!”</p>

<p>“Many persons surrounding here are top-high
aristocrats!” snarrel Mrs. Spiggott.</p>

<p>“Undoubtlessly!” snuggest Mrs. Ax. “My
Uncle Henry lives in country residence containing
800 rooms.”</p>

<p>“What are name of it—Sing Sing?” collapse
Mrs. Madam with sweetly smiling.</p>

<p>Mrs. Axweilder listen without hearing.</p>

<p>At lastly we arrive up to Cemetery View.
Country Club for slight tea-drunk. I await outside
nursing Sarah, the horse, for considerable
hour. At lastly both Mrs. Ladies approach outward
with accompaniment of their husbands who
smell quite highball. Both feminines look quite
iced as we go homeward.</p>

<p>At lastly was dinner-time. I ceased off being
coachman and became waitress, as usual.</p>

<p>“We only attemp small, cozy dinners in our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
excluded set,” explan Hon. Mrs. while 6 persons
took set-down to dinner.</p>

<p>“My dining-room contains 80 people, mostly
nobility,” report Mrs. Axweilder while eating
soup.</p>

<p>Hon. Mr. Washington Whack, who set next
by her, twist off his shirt-button from excitements.
While doing so he explain how his
family were similarly to Whacks of Tuxedo.
Hon. Axweilder refuse to speak while feeding
his indigestion. Hon. Spiggott steam up his
merriment and tell college-bred tales about
humor.</p>

<p>When all foods was finished all retreated to
parlor room where bridge-gamble was enjoyed
till late night. At 1.62 oclock Mrs. Axweilder
call Mrs. Whack an Ace &amp; Mrs. Whack reply
peevly, “Renig!” full of scorns. All make go-home
agreeing how enjoyment that evening was.</p>

<p>At 2.11 clocktime, while those Axweilders was
glad go bed, Mrs. &amp; Mr. Spiggott set alonesome
in parlor room where I could hear.</p>

<p>“Why do you bring those buffalo kittens to
rage around this neighborhood?” she ask it.
“One day more and I shall poison their foods.”</p>

<p>“They must get their fresh air somewheres,”
he reprieve.</p>

<p>“Why should they spoil ours?” she snagger.</p>

<p>“I admit it,” he jar. “What could be more
disgusting than Hon. Axweilder?”</p>

<p>“Hon. Mrs. Axweilder,” say her. So they
go bed thinking so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span></p>

<p>Next morning were churchtime.</p>

<p>“We have engaged orchestra seats for you at
church,” repose Mrs. Madam. “It will be great
treat.”</p>

<p>“What denomino church is it?” require Hon.
Axweilder.</p>

<p>“Methodist,” say her.</p>

<p>“We never go Methodist,” say him. “We are
Osteopaths.”</p>

<p>“Then you will be pleased to excuse us,” backfire
Hon. Mrs. with smiling glum. “We dare
not neglect religion for those we love.”</p>

<p>So Hon. Spiggotts depart for church, walking
together like chorus girls. Hon. Axweilders remain
in parlor room reading pictures in comical
supplement.</p>

<p>“Why you brought me to this disgustly
place?” require she from him.</p>

<p>“I agree,” he snatch back. “We should have
more fun going to hospital.”</p>

<p>When I hear this repartee I step forthly into
room with helpmeet expression.</p>

<p>“Sweethearted Weak-Enders,” I say so, “obtain
your hats and baggages with immediate
quickness and I will snuggle you away from here
before they can catch you.”</p>

<p>“What you mean by what you say?” they
require.</p>

<p>“I observe how you suffer. Therefore I help
escape.” This I say.</p>

<p>“I should muchly admire to go,” he croach,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
“yet cannot because Hon. Spiggotts would feel
sad to lose us.”</p>

<p>“Your sudden depart off would grieve them
even less,” I tell. “Last night they included you
among buffaloes and mentioned poison while
speaking of you.</p>

<p>“Oh!!” Both stand up on their stamping
feet. They rosh upstairs for bag. They rosh
downstairs with it. I go to animal garage for
hitch down Sarah.</p>

<p>Pretty soonly church-bell chime forth while
Mrs. &amp; Mr. Spiggott return backwards from
there. They observe their weak-end gasts on
porch.</p>

<p>“What—must you carry yourselves away before
Monday?” require Mrs. Spiggott for sorrow
voice.</p>

<p>“Your poor but neat home is no place
for zoological buffalos!” stroggle Hon. Mr.
Ax.</p>

<p>“And poisonous food might be expensive from
high price of drugs for economical persons,”
grubble Hon. Mrs. Ax.</p>

<p>“Who told you this &amp; that?” narrate those
Spiggotts shockly.</p>

<p>“Togo did!” say others.</p>

<p>“So thanks!” she say so for sweetness resembling
flirtatious snakes. “Please continue
your usefulness, Togo, by removing my happy
company in time to catch the time-table.”</p>

<p>Soonly I arrive up to porch-step accompanied
by Sarah, the horse. When those Weak-Enders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
and other baggage were loaded in, Hon. Mrs.
Spiggott spoke furthermore.</p>

<p>“Togo,” she pronounce, “when 1.11 train
arrives up, hitch Sarah to the depot and continue
traveling by rail with my dearie friends
who can doubtlessly afford to hire you among
their expensive servants.”</p>

<p>So I spanked up Sarah with expression of one
seeking employment where he is not needed.</p>

<p>Hoping you are the same,</p>

<small>Togo Swats the Fly</small></h2></div>


<p><i>To Editor Good Housekeeper Magazine, noble
editor who make fly-chasing delightful among
national sports.</i></p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:—Last Wedsday midnight p.m.
were historical date when I bade sad kiss-a-by
to employment from home of Mrs.
K. W. Pumphrey, North Bourbon, Ky. This
were too bad accident from my helplessness.</p>

<p>When I enter this sweethearted home Hon.
Mrs. Pumphrey say me, “Togo,” she relate, “I
am most particular about flies.”</p>

<p>“I am sure you must raise some delicious
varieties of these live stock,” I collapse for
chivalry.</p>

<p>“O not to do!” she renig hashly. “I would
sooner have a tiger in my home than a fly.”</p>

<p>“A tiger might be more noisy,” I negotiate.</p>

<p>“A tiger merely contains six claws in his
feet,” she snagger, “while a fly got 10,000
scratchers each containing 10,000,000 germs.
From this you can estimate.”</p>

<p>I attemp to do so until fatigued.</p>

<p>“From national science report arranged by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
boss doctor of John Hopsmith University I learn
considerable valuable diseases which come from
flies. Asthma, miasma, phantasma, connection
of the menbranes, loss of memory, worms (hook,
book &amp; ring) hydrophobia, anglophobia, colic,
bibliography, and jaw-lock. All these are
brought to homes from footprints of this poisonous
bird.”</p>

<p>“They should not be permitted to fly,” I abhor.</p>

<p>“It is not when they fly they are harmful.
They do the damage when they land,” she tell.</p>

<p>“In this they are similar to aeroplanes,” I
snuggest.</p>

<p>“Perhapsly!” she combust. “At any rates,
I give you instructions. Whenever you see a
fly, track him to his hole and shoe him at
once.”</p>

<p>“Only horse-flies can be shoed,” I determinate.</p>

<p>She could not assimilate this reply I said.</p>

<p>“Whenever I see flies,” she say furthermore,
“I shodder, not so much for self &amp; husband as
for dearie Baby Alexander, who are endanger.”</p>

<p>“Expect me to fear nothing including flies,”
I narrate cruelly like a Samurai.</p>

<p>Mr. Editor, when housewifely lady got fears
for something she got it even when it are not
there. I once did kitchen labor for one lady
who imagine tramps was somewhere all time.
When grocer arrive with order expression, she
holla, “Tramp!” till he say otherwise. She yall,
“Tramp!” when welcoming book-agent peddleman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
come. One day gentleman in very tired-looking
clothes arrive up to door. She screech,
“Tramp!” and quench him with hose-water.
“I am preacher,” he yellup. “I thought you
was tramp,” she oblige. “At my salary I
should be,” he negotiate while walking awayward.</p>

<p>Thusly it were with Hon. Mrs. Pumphrey
about flies. Each morning she examine fly-paper
lovingly like mariners studying charts.</p>

<p>“How much flies we caught this a.m., Togo?”
she ask it.</p>

<p>“Six,” I say it. “Five house and one butter.”</p>

<p>“Unloosen Hon. Butterfly,” she dement.
“We should not punish nature’s lovely insex
becouse of sins of others.”</p>

<p>So I grabb that lovely insex and attemp remove
him from his sticky toes. But when I done
so he turn meanly and bit me on thumb with
hot end of his poison tail.</p>

<p>“That butterfly are a wasp!” I lecture amid
Japanese word curse.</p>

<p>“Wasps does little harm,” she say sweetishly.</p>

<p>“What little they does can be noticed immediately,”
I snarrel.</p>

<p>And so onwards.</p>

<p>After 2½ days of continuous flymanship I become
extremely skilful in murder. My ears became
very bright by listening for flies. At distance
of 66 ft. I could hear Hon. Fly walking up
windows. Then was time for me. My eyebrows
containing gunpowder expression peculiar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
to Bwana Tumbo, I hide behind curtain-shade
with cruel hand containing swat-stick. Hon.
Fly approach, little imagining. Now and occasionally
he stop and rubb his mittens together
so they will be more ready to catch more diseases.
Still I await. Of suddenly I arise uply,
silently like eels drinking milk. And then.
Swatts!!!</p>

<p>By this warfare I broke considerable flies and
other dishes.</p>

<p>Hon. Pumphrey, husband, come home saying
scorn about flies.</p>

<p>“What are so fatalistic about this bug all of
a suddenly?” he ask it. “In childhood of youth
I was affectionately acquainted with flies. While
enjoying cradle-ride of infancy, flies was allowed
to buzz round my head like angel whispers. And
yet I live.”</p>

<p>“Man who talk like that never had any infancy,”
snagger Hon. Mrs. with peev.</p>

<p>“If folks in this neighborhood could pay less
attention to screen door and more to window-lock
there would be less burglary,” he otter. “6
homes has been burglarized while everybody was
busy snubbing flies.”</p>

<p>He remove one enlarged coltish revolver filled
with bullets and lay him doggishly on table.</p>

<p>“O!!!” This from Hon. Mrs.</p>

<p>“While you are executing flies I shall mutilate
burglars,” he narrate with militia voice.
“And let us see who gets it first.”</p>

<p>“Kindly not to point him this way while doing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
so,” elocute Hon. Mrs. Madam looking calm but
nervus.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="p0441_ill" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/p0441_ill.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><i>By this warfare I broke considerable flies and other dishes.</i></div>
</div>

<p>Another weeks go by and I am very much embossed
in my work. Once in occasionally Hon.
Fly come walking into home on deceptive wings,
yet I pursue. Sometime I make masher motion
with broom &amp; impale him flat against wall.
Other time I allure him gently with towl so he
flop to fly-paper where his feetsteps becomes
glue.</p>

<p>Once Hon. Fly alight downward on Baby
Alexander nose, shaking his cruel feet, intending
to leave 10,000 symptoms. Spank! I capitulate
that insex by stroking Hon. Baby on head with
apron. Yet he cry without thanks for my
bravery.</p>

<p>At lastly that house were so scarce of flies
you could not find him without advertising. All
day, while not sweeping other rugs, I search back
&amp; forthly with cruel fly-spank. Yet never a buzz
was there. Such was accomplishment of my
great science.</p>

<p>Night of Wedsday approach up. When dinner-eat
was accomplished and dish-wash ceremony
done up, my Cousin Nogi arrive to kitchen
for make conversation from Japanese politics
while eating cake, kindness of Mrs. Pumphrey
who didn’t know it. Lateness of hour arrive.
When time of 11.63 p.m. come, Nogi make
sleepy go-home while I emerge to my bedroom
expecting tomorrow, as usual.</p>

<p>I light gass. What was? Buzz! Ah, Hon.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
Fly, where was it? I turn my eyesight behind
window-curtain—and sure enough! There stood
one entirely enlarged buzzer washing his front
thumbs.</p>

<p>With sneekret expression I borrow slipper
from myself and stole forth. Crouches. Of
finally, when Hon. Fly seem to be looking at
his nose, I lep. Bangs! Yet he was too soon.
He flew uply, aeroplaned circular for moments,
and then—when less expected—start to fly outward
through door.</p>

<p>O!! This escape must not! Slightly down
hallway were child-room where Hon. Baby Alexander
layed enjoying innocent nightmares. That
fly must not arrive there to sting him with medical
diseases. If no hero was there to save him
who must? I must!</p>

<p>Therefore I rosh forwards with slippershoe in
my Samurai thumbs. With talented stroke of
match I lit gass. O yes! There were Hon. Fly
snuggling in air right over eyebrow of that infantile.
I make talented swing to lash him with
slipper, yet he were too collusive for me. Ere
I could brush him dead he make slippery-wing
motion &amp; flew to window-curtain where he hide
shyly like poets avoiding praise.</p>

<p>I should get him yet! I crouch downly, my
slipper raised uply. But while I do so—O look!
Who there?</p>

<p>Standing distinctually in doorway of child-room
I observe Hon. Mr. Pumphrey standing
like a cold ghost in pajamas. And in his righthand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
finger he held that enlarged coltish revolver.</p>

<p>“What is?” he whasper ghastly.</p>

<p>“I chase one in here!” I gollup. “He are
now coyly hiding behind curtain of window.”</p>

<p>“Were he stealing my child?” gawsp him.</p>

<p>“Not yet but maybe,” I narrate.</p>

<p>“Wait while I shoot,” he narrate while making
target movement.</p>

<p>“Ah not!” I holla. “Permit me to do so.
I have killed several with slippers.”</p>

<p>“How foolhardened is courage!” he stotter
while I lep forwards. Swatts!! with dareless
heel of slipper-shoe I collided Hon. Fly so certainly
that he broke and fell amidst dead kicks.
Prides filled my lungs. Joyly I reach downly,
and pick Hon. Fly by fingers.</p>

<p>“I save your child without expense!” I naturalize.
“Here is!”</p>

<p>“Here is what?” he require, peevly chewing
his breath.</p>

<p>“Hon. Fly,” I reject, like militia.</p>

<p>“You mean say you approach in here so
stealthly a.m.dnights for catch flies?” This
from him with flashes.</p>

<p>“I say it!”</p>

<p>“Great Scotch! And I thought it was a burglar!”
he say disappointly.</p>

<p>“So sorry I could not find one,” I gosp.</p>

<p>Hon. Mrs. Pumphrey come in while she
fainted away.</p>

<p>“Next time you come into my Baby’s room
don’t do so!” she snarrel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span></p>

<p>“Mrs, Madam,” I decry, “how can you talk
so crosswise? You tell me how slaughter flies
for their rattlesnakish crimes, yet you say scolds
when I do so.”</p>

<p>“Midnight is not fly-time,” she narrate.</p>

<p>“Maybe you are enraged because it were not
a burglar,” I snuggest. “Yet what is more
horble to have in house than a fly?”</p>

<p>“A Japanese foolboy is!” corrode Hon. Mrs.
&amp; Mr. in together voice while dejecting me outside
of screen door where I still remain, feeling
quite dissolute.</p>

<small>Togo Sails for Bargains</small></h2></div>


<p><i>To Editor Good Housekeeper Magazine who
tell all American ladies what to wear, but neglect
to explan where they can buy it.</i></p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:—I am now entirely missed
from West Dewberry, Mass, near Boston
where it is. Reason for this are dissimilarity
of intellect caused by Hon. Mrs. Violet
Sweet, lovely lady with Harvard voice and bargain
arrangement of soul. I show you how was:</p>

<p>Last Thusday in the early a.m. of forenoon
this Hon. Mrs. Sweet was setting with Boston
news-print reading it up.</p>

<p>“Oh!” This from her.</p>

<p>“What is?” I require chivalrously standing
near respectful carpet-sweep.</p>

<p>“Great sales are sailing in all Dept Stores!
With immediate quickness I must depart off and
buy one.”</p>

<p>“Can you afford this extravagance? I ask to
know.</p>

<p>“In buying bargains I never consider costs,”
she dib with mustard voice.</p>

<p>She depart offwards up stairs. Pretty soonly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
she return backwards wearing fashionable hobble
of clothing.</p>

<p>“Togo,” she say for gently smiling, “how you
like take vacation to day?”</p>

<p>“This would be good healthy for me.”</p>

<p>“I generously grant this rest to you,” she acknowledge.
“All I require you to do is to come
Boston with me &amp; carry whatever shopping I
buy.”</p>

<p>I a.m.ch obliged. So we depart off by railroad
trolley while I carry suit-case, cloak, handbag &amp;
umburella on my polite elbow. She set proudishly
in cars while I obtain rearward seat behind
her. Pretty soonly Hon. Conductor encroach to
her with carfare expression.</p>

<p>“I require transfers, if convenient,” she commute.</p>

<p>“Not to do, Hon. Lady!” reproach Hon. Conductor.
“We never give transfer on cars of
green complexion.”</p>

<p>“I shall report your backward talk,” she snib.</p>

<p>Pretty soonly she make turn-around to me.</p>

<p>“Pass me hand-bag!” she say so. I donate
that leather implement.</p>

<p>She open him up and seek inside with nervous
expression of fingers.</p>

<p>“You lost it?” I ask to know.</p>

<p>“I cannot dishcover my golden vain-box where
it is!” she holla, making more looks inside. Eccitement.
“O here is!” she exclam, bringing
up one slight box resembling golden cake of soap.
She open Hon. Suit-case, remove powder puff<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
and make slight smudge to nose with that delicious
feather. Then she put him back in box,
close box, imprison him in bag, close bag and
hand him to me.</p>

<p>“Give me suit-case,” she pronounce. I poke
forth that valuable arcticle. She open him by
brass clasp.</p>

<p>“Where are my hand-bag?” she require for
frights.</p>

<p>“Here is!” I renig. She open him up to see
if Hon. Vain Box are still comfortable, then
close him, drop him in Hon. Suit-case, and
thrust him backwards to me.</p>

<p>Pretty soonly we make changecar at Porterhouse
Junction. We make step-up into red-headed
street-car what await there.</p>

<p>“Carfare!” holla Hon. Conductor with police
expression.</p>

<p>“Give transfers to this gentleman!” she require
from me where I sat back.</p>

<p>“Hon. Conductor neglect to give us that
paper!” I negotiate. Her eyes was full of
vinegar.</p>

<p>“How dares you talk repartee after losing
transfers?” she denote. So she give 10c extravagant
cash to Hon. Conductor.</p>

<p>Nextly we came to Boston. Hon. Mrs. Sweet
make her feet very determined and at lastly we
arrive to a swollen building containing glass windows
full of wax ladies resembling Newport.
Hon. Mrs. Boss say “Oh!” with raptures and
emerge inside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span></p>

<p>Mr. Editor, I never observed so many ladies
walking circular as was inside that Hon. Dept
Store. Wholesale quantities of female people
was rushing elsewheres like Suffragettes who lost
their general.</p>

<p>In the meanwhiles Hon. Mrs. Boss were somewheres.
I could not tell. For 26 complete minutes
I make search-up while being knocked in
both directions. At lastly I dishcover her by
enlarged counter full of blue polka-dots containing
label, “DRESS SILK 19c.”</p>

<p>“Togo,” she exclam, “where are my money?”</p>

<p>“No got,” I narrate. Her nose grew angry.</p>

<p>“Are you so unintellectual that you do not
know my money is in my purse in my handbag
in my suit-case?”</p>

<p>I give her Hon. Suit-case, feeling very sorry
for my depravity.</p>

<p>Nextly we descend up elevator. On next floor
I observed a warfare. Surrounding one enlarged
sign pronouncing “Great Slaughter of Waists.”
Hon. Mrs. Sweet see this and holla, “O such
happy bargain!” Then she make inrush while
acting like a mob.</p>

<p>She attempt to remove one refined clothing
away from a fatty lady whose hat was rye on
her head.</p>

<p>“Where you come from to act so Indian?”
require Hon. Mrs. Fattish.</p>

<p>“From West Dewberry, Mass., more better
place than you!” snib Hon. Mrs. Boss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>

<p>“I shall teach you some manners,” report Hon.
Fattish making tug-jerk to waist.</p>

<p>I could not see that dear Mrs. Sweet thusly
deposed upon, so I stand forth with upturned
bundle.</p>

<p>“Stop off!” I holla to this wide woman.
“How darest you be rude to a lady?”</p>

<p>Hon. Mrs. Boss and Hon. Mrs. Stout stand
offward and look to me.</p>

<p>“Togo,” ensnap Mrs. Violet Sweet, “when
you are called on you shall be called.”</p>

<p>So I withdrew backwards and permit her to
finish that slaughter alone. Again she requesh
me for handbag. I donate it to her.</p>

<p>“I shall keep it,” she dib. “You are not safe
with valuable accumulations.”</p>

<p>So she give me one more swollen bundle for
carry and proceed onwards.</p>

<p>“Where I shall find dish-pan, curling-iron
and latest fiction-book bargain?” she require of
Hon. Floorwalk.</p>

<p>“Three floor down-side take elevator,” he
computate. We do so and arrive there where
numerous sell-ladies was there making society
conversation and other crashes of hardwear.
Hon. Mrs. Sweet buy dish-pan, price 13½c. I
carry this. She obtain pat toaster, bird-cage &amp;
complete written books of Hon. Rud Kipling. I
hang those to myself.</p>

<p>“Where I find millinary hats?” she ask out to
Hon. Sell lady.</p>

<p>“Top floor go upwards,” she indicate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span></p>

<p>We do so. I stand back at respectable distance
holding Hon. Bundle-package with fatigued
elbows resembling Santa Claus. Hon.
Mrs. set befront of mirror-glass attempting to
make herself look Vanderbilt for $3.29 price.
She try hat with roosters pointing upwards.</p>

<p>“You look very swelled for the price,” say
Hon. Sell Lady.</p>

<p>“Took it away!” commit Hon. Mrs. She try
hat with roosters dropping downwards.</p>

<p>“So joyful appearance!” suppose Hon. Sell
Lady.</p>

<p>“Remove it!” snib Hon. Mrs.</p>

<p>At lastly she choose hatwear with roosters surrounding
it in circles. Hon. Sell Lady enwrap
it in box resembling trunk and this are piled on
top of me. Thusly we start homewards.</p>

<p>At doorway Hon. Mrs. say,</p>

<p>“Oh! I must buy a pin, price 3c!” She elope
to counter and do so.</p>

<p>Mr. Editor do you realize to know how difficult
a pin can be? For 41 complete minutes we
await that important sticker, then Hon. Mrs.
must change $5 bill for remove 3c change out.
At lastly when we arrive to trolley outside, Hon.
Mrs. require,</p>

<p>“Togo, shopping are very outwearing work.”</p>

<p>“I heard so,” was loud report for me while
restraining Hon. Hat Box where he slid on my
ear.</p>

<p>At lastly we was in Porterhouse Junction setting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
in depot awaiting changecar. Of suddenly
Hon. Mrs. holla,</p>

<p>“Oh!!!”</p>

<p>“What was?” This from me.</p>

<p>“I have lost Hon. Handbag. Elope back to
Dept Store with immediate quickness and remove
it from pin-counter where is.”</p>

<p>I set down all them bundles in pile resembling
an Alp. Then I attach myself to Hon.
Trolley and ride back to where she say.</p>

<p>With Samurai elbows I sidle myself through
them broad ladies in Dept Store and arrive
up at pin-place. Oh Yes! There were that dear
Handbag laying loosely amidst pile of needles
signed “4c.” I pick him up and start offwards.</p>

<p>While I was debutting out of door with Hon.
Handbag on my proud wrist, one gentleman clasp
me by coat.</p>

<p>“You are a shop snatcher!” he acknowledged
glubly.</p>

<p>“I cannot assimulate your insult,” I renig.</p>

<p>“Where you obtain Hon. Bag?” he snuggle.</p>

<p>“He belong Hon. Mrs. Boss who is there!”
I snagger.</p>

<p>“Come long to penitentiary!” he gubble,
making dragging movements with my wrists.</p>

<p>“Hara kiri!” I yall, and before he could be
more abominable I give him jiu jitsu and knock
him over a bargain. Then I commence eloping
away with talented foot-steps.</p>

<p>“Stop Mr. Thief!” several human persons
holla, and nextly I knew I were a runaway with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
Boston attempting to catch up. I am a very
sly Japanese, Mr. Editor, and when I was sufficiently
entangled amidst streets I redoubled on
myself and escape away to other sections of
Boston where crimes was not noticed. 2 complete
hour of time I hid there amongst flats.
Then I emerge forth and catch redheaded trolley
so I should meet Hon. Mrs. at Porterhouse
Junction.</p>

<p>“Why you not stay all day?” she require
sarcastly.</p>

<p>“Should gladly do so, but Hon. Police prevent,”
I advocate.</p>

<p>“You got my handbag where was?”</p>

<p>“Yes, please!” I gave it forth to her. She
look at it with disjointed eyes.</p>

<p>“Living sakes!!!” This from her. She enjoy
deep gasp and faint off. By slight water-sip
I revive her back.</p>

<p>“Damaged remnant of heathenish immigration!”
she gollup, holding forth Hon. Bag.
“Where you snatch this article of luggage?”</p>

<p>“Off from Hon. Pin-Counter,” I say so.</p>

<p>“I never seen it before. It belong to someone
else!”</p>

<p>Thusly revolving she fainted out again. So
I left her to enjoy it by herself and sklunk away
feeling entirely impossible.</p>

<small>Togo in Bachelor’s Hall</small></h2></div>


<p><i>To Editor Good Housekeeper Magazine, who
must believe in shooing bachelors from neat
homes with other flies and mice.</i></p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Sir</span>:—If you make inquiry for
me at home of Hon. C. J. McGumm, Philadelphia,
N. J., please do not go there, because
needless to find me where I no longer am.
I changed my mind from that job of employment
for reason I say here.</p>

<p>Hon. Mrs. C. J. McGumm are blondface lady
of considerable young years and very goodhousekeeping
mind. Her Hon. Husband (of similar
name) are the only untidiness she cannot sweep
off from carpet when attacking cleanliness.</p>

<p>“Why are you so rubbish, Hon. Darling?” she
require each nightfall when he retreat home from
office with tired business appearance. “When
you are in house all furniture cease to act obedient
like it should and everything become deranged
apart. Door-knob then become hat-rack
for your derby, your coat wanders to sofa and
fall asleep, while shoes will be found under piano
kicking mud.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span></p>

<p>He act entirely sugar to her. He reply to her
inquiries by kissing expression of mustache, and
they talk dove-dove language, which explain
everything by not doing so.</p>

<p>But at lastly explodes came.</p>

<p>“Must marriage always be a cyclone?” she
require one morning a.m. when he threw newspaper
in gas-log with negligée expression.</p>

<p>“Hon. Heartsweet!” he snuggest, “I wish
be comfortable in my own home.”</p>

<p>“So ha!” Weeps enjoyed by her. “Then
you do not love me some more!”</p>

<p>“Why is?” he repostulate. “Must I prove
adoration by acting miserable around house?”</p>

<p>“You are becoming more detached from me
each day, I notice,” she lamentalize. “I can tell
by your easy, smiling manner that you think of
me too seldom. You break my house rules continuously.
Instead of setting in hard, cheap
chairs, you occupy wedding plush rocker, price
50$, which should be used only by society when
it calls; you make smoke-cigar whenever you feel
smoky; all time you read prize-fight instead of
talking love to me, and each meal you demand
apple pie with insurgent expression.”</p>

<p>“But I like apple pie,” he snuggest.</p>

<p>“Formerly you loved nothing but me,” she
snatch. “Now you forget you are married.”</p>

<p>“Must I refuse to eat because married?” he
snagger doggishly.</p>

<p>“So ha!” she dib for pain. “If that is where
your thoughts are staying, then all must cease.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
Farebye! Hence forthly you shall find me c/o
Mother.”</p>

<p>She arrange hat with traveling expression and
make bang-out from door.</p>

<p>While she depart off Hon. McGumm stand
by window-glass looking very Romeo. Sadness
showed from his ears and chin. Then suddenly
he resolve around, making humorous smiles resembling
tickled hyenas.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha,” he say so. “Tee Hee and Ho. She
imagines to think home cannot be properly
heated without a woman. She thinks shucks.
Togo, we show her how. We shall now run
this house man-style instead of lady-style.
Bachelor Hall are only proper residence for male
gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“I am agreeable for this,” I report fearlessly.
“How should we begin changing the sex of this
home?”</p>

<p>“Signs of refinement should be removed with
immediate quickness,” he devolve. “Remove
ribbons &amp; home-sweet-home portraits from wall
and order 6 cases beer. In attic you shall find
complete college-boy outfit of Indiana clubs, box-gloves,
and love-me pictures. These shall be arranged
in parlor to resemble saloon and other
outdoor sports. Prepare for dinner-eat tonight
10 lbs. complete beefsteak &amp; 9 apple pies, served
with poker-chips and onions. To night at 7 p.m.
I shall give annual banquet to members of
Yamma Yamma Fraternity of which I was a
joiner in days of manhood.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span></p>

<p>“I shall do so with all the crudeness of my
nature,” I alarm.</p>

<p>“Banzai &amp; hurrah! We are free!” holla Hon.
McGumm while he depart to office looking happy
but lonesome.</p>

<p>Mr. Editor, you scarcely could imagine how I
work to make that tender home look tough. Up
in top-garret I find considerable Yale tools. One
university row-paddle, 6 box-gloves, college pendulums
with hurrah-rah signatures on it, portraits
of class days, dogs, chorus-girls, and other
prizefights all signed “To Darling Chas.” Also
several German-speaking beer-gobblers and one
landscape representing Hon. Gaby des Lys at a
horse-race.</p>

<p>I fetch these to downstairs.</p>

<p>From parlor-room I took considerable art, representing
several mother-portraits, portrait of
“Innocence” representing childhood playing
romp, portraits of an Alp by Aunt Sapho Lutz
and considerable photo of McGumm uncles enlarged
from their ancestry. Also fire-screen containing
gilt, and tidy-cloth embroidered with artistic
yarn. Also red splush albuum and several
framed-up mottos from Shakespeare, Elb Hubbard
&amp; Genesis.</p>

<p>I fetch these to upstairs.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp97" id="p0601_ill" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/p0601_ill.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><i>When I fetch forth raw steak and apple pie all require, “What
the matter with Togo?”</i></div>
</div>

<p>With considerable talent resembling dry-goods
draping windows, I derange decorations for that
parlor-room. I pile beer-bottles to piano and
fill jardenair with cigars. A rude house motto
reporting “CAMELS ONLY DRINK ONCE<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
IN 78 DAYS BUT ENJOY IT LONG TIME”
I sat on mantelpiece where portrait of Hon.
Ralph Woodrow Emerson once were. Hon.
Punch Bag I roped from chandeleer, while landscapes
representing actor-ladies, dogs and other
glee clubs I disarranged esthetically where was.
I set parlor table with food-plates and decorate
him in central middle with box-gloves and college
pendulum containing joy-cries. Poker-chips
by each plate.</p>

<p>That room look considerable unmarried when
I finish him.</p>

<p>At promptness of six o’clock I elope to kitchen
and commence mingling steak with onions. At
6.22 I hear war-song resembling feetball, and,
peaking fourth from kitchen, I observe Hon. C.
J. McGumm bringing home a Varsity.</p>

<p>“You remember that dreary date of ’99 when
I bursted your collar-bone?” require one polar-bearish
gentleman hugging Hon. McGumm till
I heard him crack.</p>

<p>“Them were hilarious days,” commute Hon.
Boss. “Let us give rah-rah.”</p>

<p>They do so, while plaster jar loose from spoken
song.</p>

<p>When I fetch forth raw steak and apple pie,
all require, “What the matter with Togo?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, no more than usual,” I snop for
dignity. This seem to make them still more
thirsty, so beer was sipped amidst Yamma
Yamma congratulations. That ceremony were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
done very quietly while tablecloth was burning
from heated cigarette.</p>

<p>“There was nothing to equal bachelor enjoyment,”
explain Hon. C. J. McGumm while doing
so.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” report one Taft-shape athlete. “I
announce my engagement to Miss Tessie Dewberry.”</p>

<p>“We also shall marry in springtime,” pronounce
2 others distinctually. Slight glum settle
over all until basso quartet make song-sing entitled
“Soldier’s Farewell,” which add more
jolly.</p>

<p>“Let us play penny-aunty as in oldtime date,”
snuggest Hon. Boss. So they do so with considerable
card.</p>

<p>Mr. Editor, I cannot understand this gambol.
It are like golf, a game spoken in a foreign
language.</p>

<p>Considerable pile-up of poker-chip was enjoyed
while one man say “I see you!” yet look
other way. They set for long lateness gossiping
about Aunty amidst click-click noise. It seem
very tame exercise, less cruel than feetballing,
but more expensive.</p>

<p>By one a.m. time my eyes got hypnotized
from watching this straight-flushing amusement,
so I retired my head on chair and slept away.</p>

<p>At 3 a.m. by clockwork, I awoke upwards
with basso quartet retreating off with song-sing
entitled “Good-night, Lady!” Yet I could not
see her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span></p>

<p>Next morning 8 a.m. Hon. Boss Man say he
no care for breakfast in dining-room because
it make him feel destitute. So he took egg and
coffee in kitchen. He say he would be home
indefinitely, so he depart off for office seeming
entirely unmarried.</p>

<p>I took look at the appearance of that bachelor
parlor. Considerable rumpage was observed
there. Quite several cigars had remained where
they dropped and 26 bottles stood by gas-log
looking quite vacant. Portraits of dogs &amp; glee-clubs
hung on wall in unequal position, resembling
sea-storm.</p>

<p>What must I do with this room? I think
Hon. Boss had told me whether Bachelor Hall
should ever be clean. Maybe not. It certainly
look less ladylike than ever in this deranged condition.
Perhapsly Hon. Boss should be entirely
enraged if I attemp to broom &amp; dust this compartment
he had took so much pains to masculify.</p>

<p>So I set by table, lit slight cigar, and read
pugilist paper while upturning my feet. As
thusly I reclined I did not hear something coming
in front door.</p>

<p>“O!!!**??”</p>

<p>I peek upward. There stood Hon. Mrs. looking
less peaceful than hornets.</p>

<p>“Hashimura Togo, what species of brutal debutchery
have you been doing in my absentee?”
she snarrel.</p>

<p>“I no do!” I say so. “Hon. Husband do!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span></p>

<p>“Do not add untruthfulness to your falsehood,”
she snuggest snap-turtlefully.</p>

<p>“I have read in papers about the distrustworthiness
of Japanese servant-girls. But now
I know. O!!! I leave my poordear Husband
for you take care of. And thusly you neglect
him. How he must suffer!”</p>

<p>She cover her hands with her face.</p>

<p>“I swear it, Mrs. High Boss, your Hon. Husband—”</p>

<p>“Do not swear before ladies,” she snib. “Now
depart away while I faint.”</p>

<p>I do so feeling entirely decapitated.</p>

<small>Togo at the Seashore</small></h2></div>


<p><i>To Editor Good Housekeeper Magazine
who know how cook delicious varieties of seashells.</i></p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr.</span>:—Among the fresh air at Sandflea
Beach, Conn., employed by Hon. Mrs.
&amp; Mr. Liddbeater, I am no longer to be
found at that address. If some one could find
a seashore without an ocean attached to it I
should be more happily to remain.</p>

<p>Nikkamura Japanese Employment Agcy send
me there, where I arrive to smiling blue porch
setting alonesome amid winds. The internals
of that house resemble bleached almshouse, yet
Hon. Mrs. Liddbeater say she were fortunate to
obtain it in fashionable location price 200$
monthly.</p>

<p>“While by seashore we love the tough simplicity
of life,” she snuggest with sweat-hearted
expression. “We must pay expensively for our
discomforts here, yet we are prideful to do
so.”</p>

<p>“This place resemble Coney Island, yet less
fashionable,” I report for compliment while observing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
girl-i-gig machinery on beach, candy,
flirtatiousness and clams while Hon. Ocean
bounce up suddenly making suds.</p>

<p>“It are splandid place to come for rest,” she
report. “Now kindly to fetch 8 trunks upstairs,
split wood, lynch hammock on porch, and deliver
14 buckets water from artizan well 11
blocks up street. When this are finished lunching
can be prepare for 10, rugs beat, and ice-cream
friz for party tonight.”</p>

<p>I thank her and feel sure I shall enjoy this
vacation from work.</p>

<p>These Liddbeater family have got two (2)
children of assorted sexes, age 17 &amp; 18 respectfully.
Eclaire are girl name and Oliver his.
Both wear very giggling clothes and love to be
engaged. She got Stanhope Whifflebudd, deliciously
matinée boy, for hers, while Hon. Oliver
obtain sweetheart attention from Hon. Bluebell
Vawk, youngly lady of extreme tango.</p>

<p>All those frivolled young persons take rest by
not doing so. Each evening they must attend
Prof. Pffuster’s Waltzing Academy for more
education in new Max Itch dance, which are all
the enrage. Daytime they must enjoy tennis-play,
walking, quarreling, and other excitements.
Only time they remain quiet is when they go
swimming, for this they can do by laying on
beach under umburellas.</p>

<p>But when Fryday night arrive up my vacation
become considerably more entangled. From out
from depot emerge Hon. Mr. Liddbeater with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
tired business expression while reading Wall
Street news from paper.</p>

<p>“Markets are decomposing rapidly while I
am here,” he snuggest. “Unless I rest very
laboriously I must go back to my unhealth.”</p>

<p>“What shall we do to make you feel entirely
idle?” require entire family together like chorus-girls.</p>

<p>“At 4.06 tomorrow a.m. high tide shall arise
and codfish will be biting viciously,” he say so.
“Therefore we go fishing.”</p>

<p>Groans by all.</p>

<p>“Maybe you prefer to enjoy your seasickness
alone,” renig Hon. Mrs. Madam with Pankhurst
expression.</p>

<p>“Darling, I could not,” he reprieve. “I am
determined to share my pleasures with my family.
Therefore we arise upward at 3.30 to be prompt
with hooks.”</p>

<p>That midnight was night for party where I
friz ice-creams, served slight rabbits of Welsh
birth, assisted chairs where tangos was jumping,
play “Robt. E. Lee Polka” on pianola, and was
otherwise considerable talented. By 2.26 I retire
upwards to my box bedroom under cooked
roof, where I remained outside my dreams till
3.31.</p>

<p>At 3.30 come tap-knock to door.</p>

<p>“What is it?” I require with startle.</p>

<p>“3.30!” holla Hon. Liddbeater voice out there.
“Arise to go fish!”</p>

<p>“Do fish get up so early?” I ask to know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>

<p>“They bite best this hour,” he explain.</p>

<p>“I should also bite!” I snarrel.</p>

<p>“I do not pay you to make injurious comments,”
he snudged while I hastily coat &amp; pant
myself for day labor.</p>

<p>All was there awaiting for breakfast with extreme
appetite. When this devouring was finished
Stanhope and Bluebell arrive up with
flirtatious hats expected to attract fish.</p>

<p>“Togo,” demand Hon. Liddbeater like Napoleon,
“while we fish you shall go along and
whittle bait. Also prepare lunching for 10 and be
very impromptu about it.”</p>

<p>I do so and we nextly go to shore where I
must carry complete lunching including baby and
umburella. Pretty soonly we arrive to detestable
whaleboat being kept by salted gentleman resembling
damaged admiral.</p>

<p>“Will this boat hold 12?” require Hon. Boss
Man.</p>

<p>“So easily!” corrode Hon. Navy. “It were
built for six.”</p>

<p>Therefore all was compressed in while we chug
with gas-perfumery to central middle of ocean.</p>

<p>“I have feeling of slight squash,” narrate Hon.
Bluebell when we were five miles among rolls.</p>

<p>“I hold your hand for it,” report Hon. Oliver,
looking pale but poetic. He do not seem to accomplish
much medicine by this. Hon. Bluebell
become yet bluer.</p>

<p>All the ocean seem to tip up on one side as
if it was going to spill into California. Something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
inside my interior stumack seem to speak
of my dead ancestors. And look! Each stylish
person of that cruise begin concealing their happiness
by laying down on it. Groans. Yet Hon.
Liddbeater continue to make happy cheek and
smiling lip resembling Hon. Edw. Foy seeming
comic.</p>

<p>At lastly he motion Hon. Salt Gentleman to
choke his engine.</p>

<p>“This are the exact patch of waves where
Thos Cod came to chew their cud,” he explaned.
“Therefore, Hon. Capt. stop boat. Togo, while
all other fishermans lay dying, you shall cut baits
attractive to fish.”</p>

<p>“If convenient, Mr. Sir,” I bereft, “I should
prefer to join the other groans.”</p>

<p>“Continue to fish-hook or I discharge you!”
he dib.</p>

<p>“If you would discharge me back to shore I
would bless you in Japanese,” I gargle. Yet he
horribly threw me clams, unhappy mammals
which I must amputate with dull knife while
spearing them with disgustly hooks.</p>

<p>Hon. Liddbeater lit pipe of very enraged
smell. Groans by all.</p>

<p>“Nothing like pipe-smoke while fishing!” he
say for smiles.</p>

<p>“I notice,” is feebly voice from me.</p>

<p>Pretty soon Hon. Boss make electric movement
with wet string. He bite pipe more cruelly
while halling in one enraged cod who mock him
with angry mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

<p>“A beautiful fish!” he yellup joyly. “All see
it!”</p>

<p>All those sicknesses report “Um” with unhappy
nose.</p>

<p>“Are he not beautiful fish?” he ask it to me.</p>

<p>“Perhapsly when younger,” I disengage while
holding my head on.</p>

<p>Of suddenly Hon. Mrs. Liddbeater arise upwards
from pillows like a fried snake.</p>

<p>“For sake of your children,” repeat her, “I
ask you to cease making clams and people and
Japs and fish miserable for selfish joy of your
depravity. Put us somewheres where we can
run away.”</p>

<p>“Fishing cannot be accomplished by running
away,” he deploy with Samurai expression. “I
never depart off until I have caught 14.”</p>

<p>“O!!” yellup Eclaire looping beside Stanhope
and looking less engaged than usual.
“Drowning would be painless after this.”</p>

<p>“If you drowned I could save you,” dictate
Stanhope looking very pale Yale.</p>

<p>“Any shipwreck would be welcome,” mone
Oliver greenishly.</p>

<p>“Will nothing stop off your mulish fishing?”
require Hon. Mrs. waking up from her death.</p>

<p>“Unless the boat sinks I shall stay remaining
here until I catch 14,” he growell.</p>

<p>That ocean now look entirely double to me and
I could feel my courage rolling around inside my
lung.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span></p>

<p>“If the boat sink I be much obliged!” gaggle
all together like chorus-girls in hospital.</p>

<p>“I know how!” I holla with suddenness of
intelligence. “By preparing to swim you shall
snub those 14 codfish!”</p>

<p>Thusly exclamming, I lept uply &amp; grabb hammer
where it layed sleeping beside lunch. With
nimble ankles peculiar to heroes I jump to bung-plug
in central middle of that boat. Whacks!
Uply sprung plug quite corkishly and next came
huj sprout of salt Atlantic approaching inside
like giganterous fountain.</p>

<p>“Brainless species of mice!” reproach Hon.
Mr. while attempting to brush out ocean with
heel. Yet already Hon. Boat resemble bath-tub
where all set in lake. Alarming wakefulness
from seasickness was next to arrive and—before
I could acknowledge—each person make flop-splash
to water including me who was there
amidst swimming while Hon. Boat turn over on
his nose and float up-down.</p>

<p>I save Hon. Mrs. Liddbeater, lady of large
tonnage but considerable floatage. Hon. Oliver
save Hon. Bluebell. Hon. Liddbeater save himself.
Hon. Eclair save Hon. Stanhope. Hon.
Captain save Hon. Bottle. So everybody were
quite comfortable, thank you, hooking their nails
to stumack of that boat. But where was room
for me? I continue onwards splashing doggishly.</p>

<p>“Why should it?” I holla with water-spouts.
“I save you from sick-death and yet you will
not support me on your floater.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span></p>

<p>“Get off of!” snagger Hon. Mrs. giving me
crude push with heel while I attemp to sclutch.</p>

<p>“Did I not stop fish-catch?” I bubble frogfully.</p>

<p>“We can be sifficiently miserable without
you!” narrate Hon. Oliver while making water-polo
across my head.</p>

<p>“You are discharged!” howell Hon. Liddbeater.
“Report to my office in New York for
your payment.”</p>

<p>I hear this ingratitude with extreme compression
of soul. How difficult it are to be useful
when not required to do so! Therefore I would
snub them with my immediate departure.</p>

<p>Thinking thusly I struck offward in gen. direction
of New York and when lastly seen I feel
very free, although expecting to be drowned.</p>

<p>Hoping you are the same,</p>

<small>Togo Meets Hon. Clothes Line</small></h2></div>


<p><i>To Editor Good Housekeeper, who help make
civilization with soap.</i></p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr.</span>:—Another place where I am no
longer at is Rahway, N. J., working for
Mrs. H. Griddle, cultured lady.</p>

<p>I tell you why I am removed.</p>

<p>This Mrs. Griddle to who I came determined
to do Gen. Housework, have got considerable
musical ambition inside her voice. She do all
her housework at the piano. For continual hours
each day she set there making soprano, compelling
her voice to do following gymnasium:</p>


<table class="autotable" summary="">

</tr>
</table>

<p>More of this is to be continued. She say vocal
culture require great endurance. She contain
more of this noble quality than I can.</p>

<p>Washday arrive up to Griddle home by each
Monday a.m. when Hon. Maggie Kelley approach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
to laundry prepared to drown all clothing
in suds. This lady, who contains 6 feet complete
muscle, is a scrubber of great talents. She
say she was deprived of her husband several
years of yore, because he beat her frequently. I
should like to observe that athleetick gentleman.</p>

<p>A wash lady is something I prefer not to be,
above all professions.</p>

<p>But last Monday it was arranged for me.</p>

<p>“Togo,” dictate Mrs. H. Griddle, stopping her
soprano sifficiently to speak, “you will kindly
give ade to Hon. Maggie today in clothes wash
ceremony.”</p>

<p>“O thank you not to do so!” I declare with
pathos.</p>

<p>“Why so?” she snagger with Mary Garden
expression.</p>

<p>“This Hon. Maggie treat me without chivalry.
How could I be assistant scrub beside her
haughty actions?” I resolve.</p>

<p>“Either do so or deprive yourself of this job,”
she holla, departing off in high Key of C.</p>

<p>I find Hon. Maggie lady in laundry preparing
to suds. Redness appear from her hair and arms
while she look to me with cross expression peculiar
to a eagle watching an angly-worm. Then
she lift wash-boiler from stove showing energy
like Sandow juggling automobiles.</p>

<p>“Jap,” she reproach.</p>

<p>“Yes, Sir!” I pronounce.</p>

<p>“Was you sent here to look beautiful or to be
helpful?” she ask out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span></p>

<p>“Not sure—Mrs. Boss did not instruct me
which to be,” I report.</p>

<p>“I will instruct you!” she growell like a lady
menagerie. “Become busy as soonly as possible.
You will find a clothes-ringer annexed to yonder
tub. Attach yourself to the handle and ring the
cloths earnestly until I tell you quit.”</p>

<p>She point to one slight machinery resembling
a hand organ with pianola rolls. I wind this
instrument continuously. Nothing evolve.</p>

<p>“O Mrs. Madam, I cannot hear the bell!” I
suggest.</p>

<p>“Which bell please?” she otter.</p>

<p>“You tell me to ring the clothes, not so?” I
ask it.</p>

<p>“I despise you for your yellow mind!” she
dib. “Clothes does not ring when you ring
them!”</p>

<p>I could not assimilate the way she said it.
She lift several drowned clothes from the tub and
show me with considerable muscle how to squash
them through those rollers. Clothes, however
wet, can be sent through that machinery and
emerge forth with great dignity like flat snakes.
I turn crank handle continuously while Hon.
Maggie make poke-in with wettish clothing. I
enjoy great pain in my wrist and elbows, and
when I commence to quit, this laundered female
say “Faster” with bull dog expression.</p>

<p>Pretty soonly I lay down my hands and stop.
Her mad eyebrows snub me.</p>

<p>“Hon. Mrs. Wash,” I renig, “why should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
you be more cross and peeved than other persons?”</p>

<p>“Togo,” she say so, “my duties require it.
Cleaning things is a job full of tragedy and other
grouch. It would be unnatural to laugh while
washing. Clothes is pleasanter to wear, but unpleasant
to scrub. It is similar with everything.
Dishes is joyful to eat from, but nobody admire
them when hour of dishpan arrive. Nobody
love Monday, because it is sacred to splash and
suds, yet if Monday was abolished by Congress,
there would be no beautiful society on Saturday
night.”</p>

<p>“Can’t some variety of soap be invented with
more poetry in it?” I require.</p>

<p>“It could,” she dib, “but it would probably
be useless to take the dirt out.”</p>

<p>Hon. Mag fill tub with artistic color from blue
bottle.</p>

<p>“While you are idle you can do something!”
she holla suddenly like a steam whistle.</p>

<p>“How could I do something when idle?” this
inquiry from me.</p>

<p>“You see that baskett of clothes?” She point
forth to one baskett full of complete whiteness
like a bushel of damp ghosts.</p>

<p>“I observe what is.”</p>

<p>“Take them immediately for hang-out!” she
otter with gloom.</p>

<p>“What should I hang them out from?” I
require.</p>

<p>“Maybe you are not acquainted with clothesline<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>!”
she say sarcastly while she led me forth
to back yard where she introduce me to this useful
rope. “If I knew I was to come to this place
to be washing-instructor, I should demand teacher’s
salary,” she pronounce glubly.</p>

<p>“That would be nice job for deserving
widows,” I say for politeness. Yet she seem less
ladylike.</p>

<p>“To hang clothes,” she instruct, “you must
first lift them one at a time from the baskett,
grasping them by both ears—thusly.” She show
how. “You shake him twice, snap—snap!”
She demonstrate this with considerable clothes-shake.
“Then you buckle him to line with a
clothespin on each ear.” She fill her mouth with
clothespins, and then she lift one tablecloth by
his ears, shake him brutally with her pugilistic
hands, and nail him to clothes-line like she said so.</p>

<p>“You got sifficient strength enough to do
this?” she require snapply.</p>

<p>“Maybe-so, yes,” I report.</p>

<p>“If not, I give you the prize!” she say, eloping
to house without telling me which prize she
meant.</p>

<p>I put all my intellectual mind on this clothes-hang
job. It seem to be light, agreeable job for
Japanese Schoolboy—simply to lift a clothes
by his ears and glue him to rope with clothespins.
But suddenly I was reminded. That Clothes-line
was 7½ feet in highness, while I stood
merely 5 feet in lowness. How should I get up
there without flying machinery?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>

<p>I observed a step-ladder sleeping quietly by
kitchen window. It was a very diseased-looking
furniture with lameness in one leg and several
ribs fractured by too much exercise in open air,
yet it was a step-ladder. I removed this piece
of stairway to underneath clothesline where I
put him. Then I poked six (6) clothespins in my
mouth like wooden cigars. Then I took one
pillow case from baskett, shook him rudely by
his ears and ascended upwards. Hon. Ladder
wubble on his sore leg, yet I enjoy no fear, because
I am a brave Japanese. With gestures of
extreme courage I pin Hon. Pillow Case to that
stretched string where he clung with beautiful
purity peculiar to washing.</p>

<p>I began to love this clothes-hang performance.
It seemed so nice and healthful to do housework
outdoors amidst backyard scenery and gentle
summer breeze. It was very superior pleasure
for me, making up and down hops on that ladder
with agility resembling birds.</p>

<p>So I continued onwards near my duty. With
extreme earnestness I suspended following clothing
where they hung lynched upon line:</p>

<p>1 tablecloths (slightly dragged on ground, yet
quite pale).</p>

<p>9 towels (one of them dropped, but was nicely
brushed afterwards).</p>

<p>3 sox.</p>

<p>4½ pillow-case.</p>

<p>While standing tip-top on that ladder I was
enabled to observe Nature. It are wonderful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
how tall a short Japanese feels while standing
on a ladder! I could distinctly see over fence
into next yard where Hon. Swede lady employed
for cook by Mrs. J. C. Camel was making flirting
conversation with Hon. Ice Man. I also observe
Hon. Cat obtaining slight refreshment of
cream-pitcher from window while that Swede
was too interested. I stood in joyful trance holding
wet sheet while biting clothes-pin like wooden
sigars. It make such inexpensive enjoyment for
cool summer day to stand on ladder beholding
other folk’s business!</p>

<p>In the midst of everything Hon. Swede Lady
turn off suddenly and see Hon. Cat. She made
rude “Shoo!” with voice, and Hon. Cat were
so offended he fell from window in the midst of
milk pitcher and extreme breakage. With immediate
quickness he made rabid scoot for fence
with tail enlarged like a comets. “I shall attach
him for you!” I holla to Mrs. Swedish—but
soonly as I did so—O calamity!!</p>

<p>I lean too forward and Hon. Ladder stub his
toe and broke lame leg with loud scrash! Bereaved
of my support I make wildly grabb for
atmosphere, Hon. Clothesline was where I struck,
so I clasp him with tense affection. And there
I was, hanging among clothes, swinging my legs
with motion peculiar to wet stockings. Hon.
Maggie Kelley observe me in this dangled condition.</p>

<p>“Git downward!” she snuggest.</p>

<p>Before I could reproach back, Hon. Rope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
bursted and I was anticipated to ground so
forcibly that I sat there wondering what. Entire
clothes-line seemed to surround me with
damp washing like a wounded sail. Hon. Maggie
making hysteria, seize bottle of wash blue in
her prize-fight hands and approach a.m. screaming
war cries. With howell of great intensity
she threw that sky-colored liquid to my head,
covering my nose and eyebrows with splashes of
brilliant art.</p>

<p>Next she rose to house and obtain broom.
When I seen that female club, I lost my connection
with that home. I lep forwards. I fled
off. I swum over the fence with great skill and
continued to elope elsewheres. Farebye to that
job!</p>

<p>When nextly seen I was 2 miles Westward setting
among woods attempting to rub wash-fluid
from my forehead which was blue.</p>

<small>Togo Coaxes Down the Cost of Living</small></h2></div>


<p><i>To Editor Good Housekeeping Magazine who
desire to make high-life less costly.</i></p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr.</span>:—Please address all letters to
Fineheimer Employment Bureau where
I am looking for it, as usual. Sorrow for
me. Sometimes I think I am like a shoot-gun,
merely make to be fired.</p>

<p>When last seen I was employed at home of
Mrs. Ethel McManus who reside with her husband,
Mr. Ethel McManus at Honeyville-on-the-Hudson.
They are a very matrimonial couple
of people. They were married only a short time
of yore. Therefore they are living in midst of
wedding presents which they are trying to use as
furniture. How superflous!</p>

<p>“Togo,” say this lady to me, “I hire you because
we are too poor to live without a servant.”</p>

<p>“How smart idea!” I report with chivalry.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she repartee. “I learn this wisdom
from newspaper: ‘A good servant will save Hon.
Housekeeper $6 a week.’ Acting on this advice
I hire you for $5 a week, which make following
arithmetic: $6 - $5 = $1. Therefore I have
cleaned up $1 a week by transaction.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span></p>

<p>“If you kep 20 servants at that rate you could
save sufficient to keep ottomobiles,” I pronounce
joyfully.</p>

<p>“I have oftenly thought of that,” say this
bridish lady. “But I think I shall begin gradually
on 1 servant and see how much I save.”</p>

<p>“I permit you to retain all you make off me,”
I suggest for generosity.</p>

<p>“Your duties,” she utter, “is to keep high
cost of living as low-down as possible. I expect
you to buy food for our home, and to purchase it
with such financial cuteness that everything will
cost less than formerly. When Hon. Beefsteak
cost 28c per lb. I expect you to chide him until
he become more reasonable. Hon. Chicken must
walk down from his 37c perch if he wish to join
us at our table. Potatus, string-bean, butter and
salad must also act less haughty in their prices
if they wish to associate with us on bill-of-fare.
Could you manage this for our household?”</p>

<p>“Japanese are great diplomatists,” I report.
“I am willing to approach the problem with intense
stinginess.”</p>

<p>“The duties of a servant,” repeat Mrs. McManus
with expression of old-age peculiar to
brides, “the duties of a servant is to come into
more affectionate contact with butcher, baker and
icer. Thus tradesmen might be coaxed into sharing
with Housekeeper that profits which they
now selfishly keep in their business. You will
arrange this.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span></p>

<p>“I am willing to promise anything,” I collaborate.</p>

<p>“Each morning after dish-wash ceremony is
over &amp; Hon. Furnace is fed for the day, you
must promenade with basket to market where
High Cost of Living resides. It is useless for
you to squander $2 here &amp; there in reckless provisions.
I read in newspaper this morning how
one delicious and nourishing lunch for 3 persons
might be bought for 50c, including cost of gas
to cook it with. I shall try it today. My Hon.
Aunt Augusta are expected here at noon. I
require you to make miraculous meal for her.
Here is 50c. Take it and be economical.”</p>

<p>“I could not be extravagant under those circumstances,”
I renig, compressing the ½ dollar
to my pocket.</p>

<p>“Be as hasty as possible,” she beseech when
I depart.</p>

<p>“It should take no time to make 50c go a
long ways,” I encourage. “I shall saunter
among markets making storekeepers jealous by
my independent behavior. Then I shall promenade
homewards and commence to cook.”</p>

<p>I do so and this is what I done.</p>

<p>I spent 5c trolley fare and arrive to shop of
Hon. Fritz Schultz, prominent butchery. I discover
this wealthy meat-person standing befront
of his store making sweet whistles.</p>

<p>“O Hon. Mr. Sir,” I commence, “your soul
feels very musical this morning.”</p>

<p>“A butcher’s soul is like his sausage,” he confab<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>,
“full of strange and wonderful surprises.
Also I must feel slightly poetical because Spring
have arrived to my store.”</p>

<p>“Spring,” I snagger.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes,” he say off. “Beholt the signs of
Spring in my window.”</p>

<p>I notice several. One say: “SPRING LAMB!—Marked
Up to 42c.” Another say, “SPRING
CHICKEN—Formerly 18c. Reduced to 27c.”</p>

<p>“Why should meat behave so heavenly?” I
reproach. “It is continually soaring beyond.”</p>

<p>“The Trusts—they are greedy about making
profits,” he say, arranging his necktie, which was
full of diamond pins. “The Trusts are to blame,
as usual. What can I sell you this morning? I
shall be willing to part from some delicious pork
chops for twice that they are worth.”</p>

<p>“At such a price pork should taste like venison,”
I suggested.</p>

<p>“Have you got any food for sale that is less
ostentatious?” I acquit.</p>

<p>“Corn beef,” he report. “That homely dish
can be obtained for 22c per lb.”</p>

<p>“I shall take 1 lb. please,” I order.</p>

<p>“Umpossible!” he disorder. “My corn beef
come only in 5 lb. patterns.”</p>

<p>My soul drop back, completely flabbed.</p>

<p>“Ain’t you got nothing that I can buy for
15c?” I gosp.</p>

<p>“How you insult me!” he gollup, wiping
meat-axe with rage. So I depart off before chop
occur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span></p>

<p>It was now 11:30 by clock-time and I had not
yet obtained that 50c lunch. I spent 5c more
trolley fare arriving at Nusbaum’s Butchery.
This leave me 40c with which to do so with.</p>

<p>“What you got for 15c which is sifficient to
retain 3 persons, mostly ladies?” I ask from
Hon. Nusbaum. He look to me with fatty eyebrows.</p>

<p>“I can give you 3 nice mutton bones for that
price of money,” he report.</p>

<p>“Can food be made from mutton bones?” I
ask it.</p>

<p>“If properly prepared,” he renig, “they are
delicious. First they should be boiled for 4 days
in extract of beef, then stuffed with chicken giblets,
olives, muskrooms, raisons, and 12 fresh
eggs chopped finely. The cost of this dish are
as follows:</p>

<p>
Bones                   15c<br />
Chicken giblets        1.50<br />
Muskrooms               .75<br />
Eggs                    .65<br />
Raisons                 .20<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11.5em;">——</span><br />
Total Extravagance    $3.25”<br />
</p>

<p>“You call this cheap dish?” I holla nervely.</p>

<p>“You would be surprised to see how cheap it
tastes!” he suggest while I walk away from that
conversation.</p>

<p>I stand with my 40c remainder on sidewalk
and wonder what next. Ah! Vegetable lunch is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
most delicate for invalids and full of economy.
Therefore I shall go to place of Hon. Cyrus
Goldthwaite, groceries and vegetables. I arrive
there by trolley, which cost 10c because I lost
my transfer. This subtract me down to 3c.</p>

<p>“What wish?” require Cyrus Goldthwaite,
with spectacles.</p>

<p>“How much would 3 potatus cost?” I negotiate.
I was sure those vegetable would be
nourishing, because Irish eats them and remains
quite warlike.</p>

<p>“They come in all sizes,” suggest Hon.
Goldthwaite.</p>

<p>“Give them to me about ladies’ size,” I suggest,
because I knew they was for a ladies’ lunch.</p>

<p>Hon. Goldthwaite hand forth 3 gentle-looking
potatus.</p>

<p>“23c” he require.</p>

<p>“O, Hon. Groceries!” I abject. “Ladies cannot
live on potatus alone. I got 30c with which
to obtain lunch for 3. From this I must extract
5c for trolley home-trip. What bill-of-fare can
I purchase for 25c remainder?”</p>

<p>“Sardines,” he say, “are nourishing but they
tastes lonesome without crackers. These rare
fishes costs 20c per box and sifficient crackers
to chaperone them would cost 7c. This would
leave bonus of 3c for salt. Or if you would
think it more delicate you might obtain ½ lb.
cheese at 18c and 1 potatus at 7c.”</p>

<p>“I am completely puzzled by this arithmetic,”
he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span></p>

<p>“Maybe I should telephone to Mrs. McManus
and find what is,” I say so. So I do so.</p>

<p>“Hullo!”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“This is Togo.”</p>

<p>“O!” Chillbite voice.</p>

<p>“I wish to ask, please, what you would prefer
as nourishment? Would 2 potatus and one box
crackers seem more sifficient than ½ lb. cheese
and 1 potatus?”</p>

<p>“For which meal, please?” she snib.</p>

<p>“For lunch, please,” I expose.</p>

<p>“Togo!” holla blond voice from telephone,
“as it is now 1:45 in P. M. and my guest has
already went elsewheres in search for food, I can
see no sensible ratio in your horseless remarks.
How dare you show your face a.m. telephone
under such conditions?”</p>

<p>“Be more calm to me,” I besearch. “You
sent me forth with 50c to save money from food.
I done so. If your guest went away without
lunch, she saved you that much. Which were
very economical. When you substract 25c from
my traveling expenses you will still have 25c for
profits on the day. Thusly I save you from your
luxuries.”</p>

<p>“You are talking a vacuum,” she strongle.
“There is <i>one</i> luxury you shall save me from in
future.”</p>

<p>“Which luxury is that, please?” I deploy.</p>

<p>“You!” she snagger abruptly. Bang-up for
telephone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span></p>

<p>Hon. Goldthwaite charge me 10c for that telephone.
Which show that high price of talking
is also increasing rapidly upward.</p>

<p>With my remaining wealth I advance hopefully
forward towards Fineheimer Employment
Bureau which I am always welcomed.</p>

<small>Togo Becomes a Fire Hero</small></h2></div>


<p><i>To Editor Good Housekeeper Magazine who
saves more homes than insurance.</i></p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Hon. Dear Sir</span>:—Another place where I
am habitually absent can be found at
home of Hon. Mrs. &amp; Mr. Susan J.
Fogg, Turnverein, Conn. I was burnt away
from that place because of my heroism. I tell
you how was:</p>

<p>This Mrs. Fogg lady reside with her husband
and furniture in a residence, which are covered
with extremely wooden decorations, which talented
sculptors have cut out with saws. She
say it is one Queen Annie house. Perhaps so it
is. Maybe this Annie were empress of Coney
Island to build such merry architecture.</p>

<p>Hon. Mrs. Boss are considerable proud of her
house &amp; what is inside. She got an elaborate
number of plush picture-frames containing
photos of Homer. Also she got cute jugs and
pitchers walking over shelves &amp; tables resembling
decorated bugs doing so. Her dining room are
full of cut-up glasswear to resemble swollen
diamonds. Over mantel-peace are portrait-face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
of Uncle Seth, famous hero, who was scared to
death in Battle of Bully Run.</p>

<p>“Home,” she say so to me on date she hired
me for employment, “Home should be full of
objects to resemble soul of sweet lady what
keep it.”</p>

<p>“What a romping soul you must have!” I
exclam for chivalry, while rubbing eyes to observe
purply curtains and reddy carpets.</p>

<p>“My house is nearly all furnished with wedding
presents, birthday tributes and auction bargains
of happy days,” she tell proudishly. “I
value them for dear associations.”</p>

<p>“Dear associations seldom match in color,” I
narrate. She did not assimilate those words I
said it.</p>

<p>“For instancely,” she go onwards, “there is
painted fire-shovel with snow-scenery from
Grandpa’s farm. I would not take considerable
for that shovel.”</p>

<p>“How much has you been offered?” I ask
to know.</p>

<p>But she was thinking elsewheres.</p>

<p>“Togo,” she otter with serious eyebrows,
“there is not one drop of fire insurance on this
house!”</p>

<p>My heart stand on end for this informations.
“Then it would not pay to burn it!” I gosp.</p>

<p>“Daily and nightly,” she agnosticate, “I
worry with brain for fear some spark or blazes
might walk into my home and burn all my sweet
art and dear menorandum to zero of ashes!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span></p>

<p>“I shall smother all arson with great cruelty,”
are fire-chief promise I make.</p>

<p>So Hon. Mrs. Fogg donate to me one smallish
volume of book entitled “First Ade to Fires.”
This literature, which is bound in 4th of July
color, tell me following information about fire
when he gets loose:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Chimbleys are most dangerous articles to
have around a house because they gets clogged
with soot, thusly causing inflammation of the
roof which creates blazes and burns insurance.
Total loss. Best way to put out a mad
chimbley is to sprinkle salt down him until he
quits.</p>

<p>“In case of houseafire, human folks must be
saved before all other furniture, because they
are most combustable. This can be did by throwing
wet blanket over them and dragging them
forth. Valuable heirlooms can be saved from
burning house by taking them out.”</p>
</div>

<p>I read this instructions, Mr. Editor, and feel
prepared for anything.</p>

<p>This Mrs. Fogg got one Irish cooklady name
of Hilda Katz. Hon. Hilda are beautiful, except
her face and figure, which are not. She enjoy
very sorry romance, because of Hon. Wm., a
hack-driver, who drove away with another
fiancée and remain there. Consequent of this,
Hon. Hilda weep &amp; cook nearly all time.</p>

<p>“Togo,” she report to me, while making tears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
and pies, “never promise to marry any gentleman
in the livery-stable business.”</p>

<p>“I shall avoid this peril firmly,” I narrate.</p>

<p>“67 doz assorted love-letters this Wm. sent
me. And what usefulness are they now?”
Weeps by her.</p>

<p>“They might make a sad novel, if printed
among pictures,” I say so.</p>

<p>She peel onions with Romeo expression.</p>

<p>But I were too busy being a fire-detective to
think of Wm. and his escape from love. Nearly
each hour by clock-time Hon. Mrs. would come
to me and talk underwriter language:</p>

<p>“You hear that smell of smoke?” she require.</p>

<p>“It smell like New Haven Railroad burning
dividends six miles away,” I say with syrup
voice.</p>

<p>One day, my Cousin Nogi give me sweethearted
gift of one valuable cigar, price 5c. cash-money.
I nourish this dear tobacco very carefully
in pocket and await till late night-hour when
I could smoke him in my room &amp; think of my
ancestors. So I lock door, open window and do
so. In midst of puffs I hear something.</p>

<p>Knock-knock! This noise by Hon. Door. I
unlock lock and gaze outside to where Hon. Mrs.
Fogg was there with kimono &amp; pale eyebrows.</p>

<p>“Some odor is burning in this house!” she
gollup.</p>

<p>“What perfume of smell do it resemble?” I
ask it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span></p>

<p>“It resemble a fire among dry goods,” she
gubble.</p>

<p>“Be calmly quiet,” I negotiate. “The smell
you heard was merely only slight gift-cigar I
smoke in honor of my Cousin Nogi.”</p>

<p>“I would avoid such a cousin,” she snib with
nose. “Blow out gas and go to bed at oncely!”</p>

<p>I could hear her peevishness by her feet as
they walked.</p>

<p>It were nice, balmish evening of summer
weather when Mrs. and Mr. Chas Hassock,
neighborly persons of quiet fashion, was there to
play bridge-gamble amidst society clothing. Hon.
Mr. Fogg, medium gentleman with tame whiskers,
were also there acting like a husbandman.</p>

<p>Bridge-card resume for several hours while
those 4 persons sat there calling each other
“Trumps” and other American insults.</p>

<p>O suddenly!! what was that my nose
smelled? Inflammatory smell of fire!!</p>

<p>With iced brain I recall what “First Ade to
Fires” said about mad chimbleys, so I rosh
silently to outside house to see how ours were
behaving. O surely yes! Hon. Chimbley were
shooting sparkles &amp; pin-wheels from his enraged
bricks!</p>

<p>What I do then? With immediate quickness,
I rosh to dining-room and grab 2 salt-sellers in
my courageous thumbs. Making my toes extremely
swift, I clomb ladder to roof &amp; scramble
along shingles with care peculiar to Thos. Cats.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
Then, by heroic movements of wrists, I pepper
considerable salt straight into the face of that
mad Chimbley. Yet he still continue on making
Vesuvius out of himself.</p>

<p>What nextly must I do? I think of that fire-volume
which say, “<i>Human folks must be saved
before all other furniture</i>.”</p>

<p>So I scomper to bed-room, dragg forth one
complete blanket &amp; soush him in wet water of
bath-tub. With these blanket held in my firm
knuckles, I ascended downstairs to parlor where
Hon. Mrs. Fogg set in her marcel hair and considerable
expensive face-powder calling Mrs.
Hassock a “Renig” in bridge-language.</p>

<p>With wetness of blanket, I stand behind Hon.
Mrs. Fogg.</p>

<p>“What for?” she holla when she seen me.
But before anything else could collapse, I wound
wettish blanket round her head.</p>

<p>“Gog!” she report with strangely voice. Yet,
before she could narrate more, I had drogged
her forthly to fresh air.</p>

<p>“What is the meaning of this meanness?” require
Hon. Fogg.</p>

<p>“Meaning of Fire!” I yellup. “Why do you
stand there making speechless talks, when your
home is sparking?”</p>

<p>At this oratory of words, everybody begin
making hook-and-ladder movements. Hon.
Fogg grabb bird-cage and pair of tongs. Hon.
Mrs. save 3 plush albums. Hon. Hassock attemp
to remove sideboard, but it were nailed to floor.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
Hon. Mrs. Hassock rosh down street breaking
fire-alarms out of telephone poles.</p>

<p>But I were more Sandow in my strength.
With Samurai knuckles, I grasp cabinet full of
cut-up glasswear and roll him down front steps
to lawn. Loud crashes! Thusly was valuable
dishes saved from fire.</p>

<p>With deer-foot heels, I eloped upstairs to bedroom
and begin pouring entire household out of
window. Mattrass, pitchers, rugs, etc., fell like
Niagara falling. When I threw forth family
water-color landscape representing the face of
Aunt Nerissa Hodges, it make boomerang fly-off
and struck on head of Hon. Fogg which went
through. Too bad.</p>

<p>I were just in the heroism of poking brass
bedstead through pane of glass, when Mrs. and
Mr. Fogg escorted by Mrs. and Mr. Hassock and
Hon. Hilda Katz, cook-lady, suddenly encroach
into room and seeze me.</p>

<p>“Platoon of brainless mind!” they all hiss
like circular snakes. “Who inform you this
house were blaze?”</p>

<p>“Did I not see Hon. Chimbley spitting rockets?”
This from me.</p>

<p>“Sakes of shucks!” commute Hon. Hilda
contemptibly. “That were not house-afire.
That were merely me burning negligent love-letters
in kitchen stove.”</p>

<p>Grones by all.</p>

<p>“So my house are not afire!” report Hon.
Mrs. for disappoint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span></p>

<p>“So sorry!” I regret. In distant midnight I
could hear rural hose-carriage approaching with
gongs. “Maybe there was no fire, but this were
very useful practice. Also I was enabled to show
you the iced quality of my intelligence. If there
had been some fire, I should put it out!”</p>

<p>“You have put nearly everything else out,”
sorrowfully Hon. Mrs., looking outside to moonlight
where the entire interior of her home lay
scrambled on the lawn.</p>

<p>Hon. Fogg gargle with his teeth.</p>

<p>“Since you are so talented at putting things
out,” he suggest, “perhaps you can place yourself
elsewheres with immediate rapidness.”</p>

<p>I oblige. When nextly observed, I were setting
in R. R. Station awaiting for morning train
and feeling quite roasted.</p>

<small>Togo Makes Discoveries</small></h2></div>


<p><i>To Editor Good Housekeeper Magazine,
whose mind thinks recipes.</i></p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Editor</span>:—When Hon. Chris
Columbus dishcovered America, he do so
at his own risk. It are muchly the same
with Gen. Housework—all persons must be entirely
careful about what they find out, because
they can’t always do something with it. I know
because I try.</p>

<p>My last former address was home of Hon.
Mrs. J. B. Cluck, Canton, O. I am now employed
there as an absentee. Mr. Editor, you
and your magazine are blame for the miserable
anecdote what happen to me there. I tell you,
Mr. Editor Good Housekeeper, how was:</p>

<p>This Hon. Cluck lady suddenly approach up to
me last Tues. a.m. &amp; say with voice,</p>

<p>“Togo,” she say so, “I am delightful reader
of Good Housekeeper Magazine.”</p>

<p>“You are one in several 1,000,000,” I snatch
back, with expression of rapid circulation.</p>

<p>“In this wonderfully home-made periodical,”
she divulge, “I are frequently suprised to read<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
one department name of ‘Dishcoveries,’ what tell
considerable knowledge to ladies what require to
make housework unexpected. This month Dishcoveries’
give bright recipes on following subjects:</p>

<p>“‘How to make pincushions from potatoes.</p>

<p>“‘How to keep moths out of moth-bags.</p>

<p>“‘How to make babies cry by music.’”</p>

<p>I assimulate her words with eyebrows.</p>

<p>“It seem insulting to sell so much wisdom for
15c,” I contuse.</p>

<p>“Recipes like this,” decry Hon. Mrs., “are
good ways to know. Every servant girl, whether
male or female, should read those ‘Dishcoveries’
&amp; attempt to do so also. New things can be
thought of only by thinking of something new.
Therefore, remember I expect you to make some
useful ‘Dish-covery’ each week you are in this
home.”</p>

<p>With such language, she suddenly eloped
away, leaving my hands in thoughtful dishwater.</p>

<p>Mr. Editor, it are easier to be Shakespeare
than Edison. Hon. Shak. merely composed
poetry, but Hon. Ed. has to compose inventions
what actually go when expected to.</p>

<p>When Hon. Mrs. Cluck require me to think
up some Dishcovery, I were completely flabbed
to find what was. Nearly everything seemed to
be already thought of to make home easier—hot
water, ice man, gas, etc. Brooms was there to
sweep with, foods to cook with, each thing for
to do so. When I look around that home, all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
full of everything, I feel like North Pole after
Hon. Doc Cook was there—nothing else left to
dishcover.</p>

<p>That week my brain grew sidewise from too
much originality. Yet no useful thought come
up.</p>

<p>With frequent occasionality, Hon. Mrs. Cluck
approach and dement,</p>

<p>“You find that Dishcovery yet, Togo?”</p>

<p>“Great explorers requires overtime to do so,”
I relate.</p>

<p>No intellectual reply from her.</p>

<p>Wedsday pass, Thursday pass while Fryday
&amp; Satday proceed in similar manner. At last it
was Sunday.</p>

<p>This Sunday are devoted to stay-home amusement
by Hon. Cluck, who are a bald-haired gentleman
of medium oldness. He spend this vacation
by setting in slippers and enjoying quarrels
he is too busy to attend to other days. When
these is finished, he reads comical supplements
until fatigued by humor, when he spreads Hon.
Happy Hooligan page over his bald hair and
commences to snore. This program are enjoyed
to any extent while Hon. Mrs. telephone her
Mother to explain how sad her marriage was.</p>

<p>“Jas!” holla Hon. Mrs. to Hon. Mr., last
Sunday while he was leaping from one nap to
another, “Why should you save your snores for
your Wife?”</p>

<p>“You comfort me so I cannot keep wakeful,”
he smooth back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span></p>

<p>“Do you snore while being comforted by a—stenographer?”
she gollup so quickly.</p>

<p>He said nothing very well.</p>

<p>“Oh!!” This from her. “If I could dishcover
some way for to keep you from going to
sleep every time you sat in that chair, I should
be submerged by much gratitude.”</p>

<p>I was standing in next room near keyhole
trying not to listen when I axidentally hear her
make this dialogue.</p>

<p>Zizz!! Intellectual flash arrive to brain: I
should make one Dishcovery what would give
Hon. Cluck happy-home wakefulness when setting
in that chair. Banzai! I stogger backwards
with Edison feeling of thumbs.</p>

<p>Next a.m. while Hon. Mrs. were absentee at
Dept Store squandering money on hair-pins, I
approach Hon. Chair where husband love to
dream. With artistic hammer &amp; nails, I attach
Hon. Chair to rope in next room which were
pulled by neat derangement of pulleys. He were
a Mawruss Chair, full of pads and very fat, and
I was proud to see the expression of calm comfort
what he wear while setting there awaiting
happy home-come of Hon. Mr. Cluck.</p>

<p>When Hon. Mrs. Cluck arrive back for dinner
that evening, food were absent, for reason
because I had been too busy with importance to
think up such triful.</p>

<p>“Why you no cook for eat it?” she require
with hawk voice.</p>

<p>“I have cooked something more grand than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
merely stomach food,” I snuggest. “While you
was absentee, I have been preparing something
elegant for the brain to chew: I have made a
Dishcovery!”</p>

<p>“O narrate it to me!” she collapse for vasty
excitements.</p>

<p>“Not to do!” I holla. “Such thoughts must
be delivered by express to editor of Good Housekeeper
Magazine.”</p>

<p>She glub slightly, but I was firm.</p>

<p>“If you have time to spare from your scientific
study, please prepare what hash there is in
the house for food which is 2½ hours late.”
She say it.</p>

<p>At 6:47 hour, Hon. Cluck return back in usual
mood of joyless anticipation. He say several
nouns expressing lateness of Japanese cookery,
then he remove off coat, collar, neckbow &amp; shoe-ware,
expecting to put on house slippers and
smoke-jacket and manufacture comfort.</p>

<p>“If Togo shall be till breakfast preparing dinner,
I shall go to my Mawruss Chair and enjoy
slight kitten nap,” Hon. Mister glump.</p>

<p>“If you had more regular profiles, you would
be a sleeping beauty,” contuse Hon. Mrs.</p>

<p>“If this home was run right, it would not be
run down!” combust him.</p>

<p>“If you was not a fungus, you might be a
genius,” detone her.</p>

<p>I were deliciously relieved to hear them talk
that way, because I knew they would get so
interested in unpleasantness that Hon. Cluck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
would forget to go sleep in Mawruss Chair until
after dinner was ate. And then I would have
time to show my Dishcovery.</p>

<p>And so it was. While I prepare what hash I
could find, Hon. Cluck spent time pacing backwards
and reverse with expression peculiar to
Admirals on July 4th. At lastly dinner set himself
on table while Hon. Cluck devoured big dinner
amidst usual steam-roller grumbel about my
unhappy cooking.</p>

<p>“Can’t you recall some sweet language to
make marriage pleasant?” renag Mrs. Cluck.</p>

<p>“Marriage are only pleasant when he are
asleep,” he peruse, looking expectfully to Mawruss
Chair.</p>

<p>When it come to pie time, I could already
observe dormatory expression of lodging-house
crowling over fatty face of Hon. Boss. Yawns
by him. Stretches. At lastly, he arose upwards,
lit cigar, rubbed his tired business eyes &amp; started
for library.</p>

<p>“I think one slight, little nap in Mawruss
Chair will prepare me,” he say so to Wife.</p>

<p>“Prepare you for what?” she dib back at
Hon. Husband.</p>

<p>“For go to bed,” he resnort. He make sluggardly
walk toward Mawruss Chair.</p>

<p>Now I knew it were time for activity, if my
Dishcovery would be useful. So I ran with silent
speed of cats towards other room where end of
rope was. Through library door, I could see
Hon. Chair setting there with dimpled pads. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
grabb rope detatched to pulleys what led to Hon.
Chair. Next thing I could see Hon. Cluck back
up towards Chair, stretch lovingly, and crouch his
knees as if intending to set down. But he wasn’t.</p>

<p>YANKS!!! With hero strength, I pull rope
which cause Hon. Chair to sidle backwards on
castor. Consequence of this was large. Hon.
Cluck, suddenly dejected from his set down, fell
on his collar button, arriving to carpet so hippo-ponderously
that entire home were jarred loose.</p>

<p>“O darling Mr. Husband, are you gone?” require
Mrs. Wife, lopping over him with heroine
expression peculiar to Julia Marlowe.</p>

<p>“Can’t you tell I am here by the noise?” he
gubble. “What spirituous medium has came
here to pull away my chair with unseen hands?”</p>

<p>“I do it!” I explode with great quickness suddenly
emerging forth from curtains like primadonna
making first entrance when band play with
great exuberance.</p>

<p>“<i>Why</i> you done it?” Both Hon. Mister and
Hon. Mrs. spoke together like mad chorus girls.</p>

<p>“It was fault of you &amp; Good Housekeeper
Magazine!” I snuggest to her. “Did you not
tell me every servant girl should make Dishcovery
of something needed in the home?”</p>

<p>“Perhapsly I did,” Hon. Mrs. rosp back with
question-mark.</p>

<p>“Did you not tell Hon. Husband something
must be did to keep him from sleeping in Mawruss
Chair after big dinner every day?”</p>

<p>“I said thusly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span></p>

<p>“Well!” This from me. “I have cooked up
an Invention what will keep Hon. Sir from all
snores. Reward me, please!”</p>

<p>For immediate payment, Hon. Cluck arouse
up with voice peculiar to zoology. He annexed
me by the seat of my collar &amp; left me outside
where I stood long time.</p>

<p>Mr. Editor, if you wish this Dishcovery for
your page it will be yours for the cheapness of
dirt.</p>

<small>Togo’s Thanksgiving</small></h2></div>

<p><i>To Editor Good Housekeeper Magazine, who
keep cheerful in spite of Holidays.</i></p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:—While annual yearly date of
Thangsgive approach up, I enjoy pain
in connection with my memory. Americans
act so peculiar when thankful that I am not
insured what to do. For instancely, I tell you
what collapsed to me last Thanksgive Thursday:</p>

<p>I were employed for Gen. Cookery at domestic
kitchen of Mrs. &amp; Mr. Romeo Goober,
East O’Rora, Ill.</p>

<p>“Togo,” say Hon. Mrs., approaching up to me,
“tomorrow shall be Thanksgive Day.”</p>

<p>“What are origin of this joy?” I ask to know.</p>

<p>“Pilgrim 4 Fathers first invented it,” she report.
“In historical time of 1492, Hon. Miles
Standish were setting on Plymouth Rock. ‘We
have no foods,’decry Hon. Miles. ‘I have no
appetite,’ snuggest Hon. Jno. W. Alden, assistant
Pilgrim. ‘We should be thankful for that!’ negotiate
Hon. Miles, so Thankful Thursday were
manufactured from that date.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span></p>

<p>“How you shall celebrate this patriotic festival?”
I require.</p>

<p>“By eating it,” decrop Hon. Mrs. “The more
we eat, the more patriotic we become. On that
Thursday date America are thankful about all
sorts of calamities, while families group themselves
around turkey to express gratitude and
cramberry sauce.”</p>

<p>“My heart stands upright to think of such
cheerfulness!” I resort. “I shall rejoice tomorrow
for to observe one American dinner
where Kick &amp; Peev are not invited.”</p>

<p>“Tomorrow we expects to celebrate as usual,”
she report for sweetly smiling. There will be
8 to dinner, to include my fattish Uncle Seth
who equal 3 more. All my relatives is most
sneerful particular about foods. So now will
you please elope immediately to market for buy
one turkey-chicken of 26 lbs. complete tenderness,
4 qrts. cramberries of delicious sourness, 6
bunches celery-weed, and sufficient punkens to
construct 2½ pies?”</p>

<p>I go. At Gouge Bros. Market where was I
observe sign, “FAT TURKEY 35c.” To see
this, I feel very humorous about that High Cost
of Life.</p>

<p>“Such delicious cheapness of bird!” I negotiate
to Hon. Butcher who was there. “At
such rates, how much would 2 turkies cost?”</p>

<p>“$22.80,” he report for immediate arithmatic.</p>

<p>“Do you not promise fat turkey for 35c?” I
rake off.</p>

  <div class="caption"><i>“Have he not been constantly on ice for 2 yrs? Nothing could

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span></p>

<p>“35c per lb.,” he snagger financially.</p>

<p>“I should like one (1) lb., please!” This
from me.</p>

<p>“We do not sell broken sections. You must
purchase complete bird, price $9.80.” This from
him.</p>

<p>“At such rates, folks can get rich by starving,”
I snagger.</p>

<p>No response from him. He go to ice-box
and fetch forth one enlarged fowel without any
clothing on.</p>

<p>“This are nice fresh turkey,” he satisfy.</p>

<p>“How you know he fresh?” I snuggest.</p>

<p>“Have he not been constantly on ice for 2
yrs.? Nothing could be more fresher than that,”
depose Hon. Butch. I buy.</p>

<p>He sell me expensive celery-bouquet, price
75c per cluster. It seem disrespectful to eat such
valuation. Also precious cramberries, price $1
for seldom quantities, added to $2.50 worth punkens
for pie. I promenade homewards, carrying
this valuable butchery and hoping no burglar
would see me.</p>

<p>While I was thusly straggling along with burdened
back, one assorted dog, name of Hon.
Fido, snux up behind of turkey and made smiling
sniff-nose.</p>

<p>“Shoo!” I report. Hon. Fido stood waggishly
saying nothing, but looking at Hon. Turkey with
flirting eye. I was joyful to observe this, because
Hon. Shakespeare say, “Them what dogs
loves must have many tender qualities.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span></p>

<p>Date of Thankful Thursday arrive up. By
early a.m. of dawntime I arose up and commenced.
All a.m. that assorted dog, Hon. Fido,
set outside screen door. I permit him. I arrange
Hon. Turkey to polite position and stuff his surprised
interior with decorated crumbs. I satisfy
him with salt &amp; pepper.</p>

<p>About time of afternoon p.m., I could hear
several thanksgivers scraping their footprints on
rug. Their feet sounded quite hungry, yet I
could not hear any words spoken more cheerful
than Sunday. Hon. Turkey now send forth
smiling smell of bakery, and I was glad to assist
his importance.</p>

<p>Pretty soonly all take set-down to table.</p>

<p>“We got much to be thanksgiving for,” report
Hon. Goober with sharp knife. “Dinner is late
as usual.”</p>

<p>“Too bad weather are so full of dishagreeable
qualities!” grubble Aunt Hannah with golden
teeth.</p>

<p>“It were not thusly when I was a boy,” report
Uncle Seth with grone. “Please pass the
celery.”</p>

<p>He make smack-taste of this foods, then flop
it back with snubbed expression.</p>

<p>“I have tasted no respectable celery since
1841!” he holla baffably.</p>

<p>All enjoy depression by this report.</p>

<p>Next course was oysters, served with considerable
rawness. Cousin Fred’rck make jab to
these shelled fish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span></p>

<p>“Don’t!” holla Aunt Eliz, making horror
with her nose.</p>

<p>“Why should not?” require Cousin Fred’rck
while he swallow up.</p>

<p>“You are so young and yet dead already!”
ollicute Aunt Eliz. “Toe-main poison are sure
to resume from this.”</p>

<p>“Food contained less poison when I was a
childhood,” negotiate Uncle Seth.</p>

<p>“Bygone days has went!” extract Aunt Eliz
with si &amp; grone.</p>

<p>I go to kitchen for bring in delicious mulligantawny
soup what I bought. While I were pouring
this hot beveridge in plates, I notice slight
smell of burn. It was Hon. Turkey in oven, becoming
too feverish. So I took him out and put
him by window where he be more comfortable.</p>

<p>I fetch soup in plates to all those thanksgivers.</p>

<p>“Canned!” they yellup together with voice of
sad chorus girls, while thrusting away plates.</p>

<p>“Nothing is real any more!” narrate Uncle
Seth with dyspepsia. “Even turkies is deceptive.
When boyhood days elapsed, I can remember
how we was accustomed, on Thanksgive
morning, to salute Hon. Turkey by chopping him
in kneck with ax. We knew he was good to eat,
because we seen how fresh he acted. But no
more. Today, turkies lives like Eskimos—spending
their old age on ice before meeting civilized
persons. No respectable bird-dog would eat
them.”</p>

<p>I enjoy considerable alarm for this thanksgiving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
speech. Then, courageous like a Samurai,
I retreat to kitchen for fetch forth Hon. Turkey.
Hope thrilled my wrists and elbows as I entered
kitchen for escort that sublime turkey—but
O!!! I stand gast. I look to window where
I left that sacred bird. Such things could not!
And it was. Empty pan stood there, seeming
entirely vacuum. Hon. Turkey had flewed
away!!</p>

<p>I rosh by window and look earnestly to back
yard. Yes!! With thankful expression of tail,
there stood Hon. Fido abducting Hon. Turkey
across alley by wing.</p>

<p>“Come backwards!” I yellup. Hon. Fido
show no impression from my talk. I lep through
window 7½ feet to outside. Quickly reassuring
my legs, I retreat after that slyly doggish annimle,
but he scromble up fence with hooked claws resembling
cats. Too late for me! Turkey had
escaped from my Bulgarian catch-up.</p>

<p>Mr. Editor, heroes is most brave when reporting
failures. I do this considerably. So I drag
together my soul and encroach toward dining-room,
where I could hear those 8 thanksgivers
complaining about everything. I walk in there
carrying empty pan. Uncle Seth were just saying,</p>

<p>“Turkey are not what he used to be in 1868!”</p>

<p>“It are painful to look one in face!” report
Aunt Eliz, while all agree.</p>

<p>“Banzai!” I holla, poking forth vacant dish.
“Your digestion shall avoid this agony.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span></p>

<p>“What is?” all exclam while leapting to their
feetware.</p>

<p>“You should all be very thanksgiving,” I
snuggest. “You have been rescued from considerable
preserved poison by one patriotic dog
what sacrifice himself by eloping with Hon. Turkey
before he could be ate.”</p>

<p>“Kill the dishonest mammal!” all gollup with
thankless expression.</p>

<p>“Why you should want I kill dog for stealing
turkey you do not require?” I ask with Teddy
Roosevelt voice. “He should be gave medal
of Pilgrim 4 Fathers for eating a bird you would
not dare to bite.”</p>

<p>“Then you mean we shall have no turkey?”
snagger all.</p>

<p>“You shall be spared that calamity,” I say off.</p>

<p>“How lonesome Thanksgive dinner seem
without him!” mone Uncle Seth.</p>

<p>“How can we fill his vacant platter?” sobb
Hon. Mrs. “I should be thankful for Hon.
Turkey, however tough!”</p>

<p>Just while she say this—crashy!! Loud
sound of approaching dog heard from kitchen
window, and Hon. Fido with waggish tail trott
into dining-room, carrying that enormalous bird
in his careful teeth. He lay that absent fowel
reverently a.m. feets.</p>

<p>“Hon. Fido do not care for this enlarged
chicken, so he bring him back,” I report.</p>

<p>“Dinner are now spoilt!” decry Hon. Mrs.</p>

<p>“How could you speak it?” I research.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
“When turkey go, you say, ‘Dinner ruined!’
‘When he come back, you say, ‘Dinner spoilt!’
I am impossible to understand about American
customs.</p>

<p>“You have Thanksgive dinner so you can set
around making bewails. So foolish to do! Why
you no choose this date for to kick out Misfortune?”</p>

<p>“I shall do so!” abrupt Hon. Goober, arising
upwards. “First Misfortune to kick will be in
your direction.”</p>

<p>Next he rejected me through window by force
of Swedish jiu-jitsu. Hon. Fido arrive by next
kick, and Hon. Turkey flew afterward, striking
me on hair so earnestly he left me quite brainless.</p>

<p>Hoping you are the same,</p>

<small>Togo Seeks Tea and Finds Tango</small></h2></div>

<p><i>To Editor Good Housekeeping Magazine
who must realize the extreme difficulty of keeping
home dull,</i></p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:—I have leaped so continuously
from jobs to jobs since you last heard
from me that I am becoming a very talented
bounder. The nearly last place to which
I was attached rejected me away because of my
extreme industry in sweeping carpets while company
was there to sneeze. Boss Lady at that
place was kind but brutal, so she give me following
letter of recomment to quit with:</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">To Who This May Supply</span>:—<br />
</p>

<p>This introduces our Mr. Togo (retired). If
you want to see what a housemaid he is, try him.
He is capable of anything. Please treat him
like I did.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Mary L. Montfusser.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Next place where I took this note were home
of Hon. Mrs. &amp; Mr. Wm. Vanderbitt Jones,
residing in very swollen location located near<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
Aspic Falls, N. J. That neighborhood was so
formula that it make me feel quite English while
approaching up to it. I was included into rear
entrance amid buttlers, where Hon. Mrs. Vanderbitt
Jones, crystalized lady of expensive
beauty, arrive there and require, “You unstand
how serve tea?”</p>

<p>“Tea are favorite drunk of Japan,” I exaggerate
pridefully. “It are served there with
ceremony——”</p>

<p>“It are served here with tango,” she snib
stylishly. “Did you ever learn how?”</p>

<p>“Never yet,” I nudge, “yet I can quickly
learn to include that amid cream &amp; sugar.”</p>

<p>“How irritated!” she snib while making her
fingers touch her fashionable hairs. “Howeverly,
since it is too late already, you must remain
staying.”</p>

<p>A English buttler without any H in his words
took me to long room and show me how pile up
furniture and remove off all explosive glassware
from table.</p>

<p>“Why you make so much removal?” I ask to
know.</p>

<p>“When tea-drink begin they commence dance,”
he acknowledge.</p>

<p>“Tea never make persons dance in Japan,” I
snagger.</p>

<p>“It are only commencing to have that effect
in America,” he explain. “But in 1914 it are
fashionable to have it go to feet when swallowed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span></p>

<p>I were chewing this education with my brain
when confused varieties of Smart Setters arrive
up with enlarged limousine hacks and make ha-ha
handshake including Vernon Castle expression.</p>

<p>I notice great absence of that stiff-souled dignity
peculiar to Japanese Ambassadors when
thirsty for Oolong. Everybody acted like a divorce
and some ladies appeared considerable
Geisha.</p>

<p>Hon. Mrs. Vanderbitt Jones stand by rugs,
with flirting expression and say, “Howdy,
Freddy,” whenever Newport clothing arrive up.
Musical orchestra from behind palm-bushes
commence play “O You Gabble Gabble Glide”
and nobody could prevent misbehavior of feet.
Considerable gentlemen then obtain seizure of
considerable ladies and commence circulating
with stride away expression of knees.</p>

<p>“If this is tea where is it?” I require from
my soul. No answer as yet.</p>

<p>My eyes equaled Sherlock’s in search of that
beveridge which should be there. I could not
detect. No appearance of steepage, cup-saucer,
sammyvar, or other tools for making that hot
sip. Yet somewheres I could hear dice-box
sound peculiar to small icebergs clattering together.
O yes! I saw. Coyly concealing behind
palm-bushes I observe considerable buttler
shaking up tea in silver jigglers to include
ice.</p>

<p>Pretty soonly lady &amp; gentleman arrive up full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
of fatigues from so much slouchy-slouchy dance-step.</p>

<p>“We will take slight tea,” they dement from
Hon. Buttler.</p>

<p>“What variety, please?” he require servantly.</p>

<p>“Martini,” snuggest those couple. Hon. Buttler
pour. More pairs of persons emerge up.
More shakes with ice. More gobbles. More
dances.</p>

<p>Hon. Mrs. Vanderbitt Jones, formerly very
clam-eye and Buckingham in her appearance of
silk clothing, abruptly seize one smallish dance-gentleman
and become more Geisha than all
others collapsed together.</p>

<p>“It are tango who put the tease into tea,” renounce
one gentleman-boy twirkling by with
lady-girl.</p>

<p>“You are very Bernard Shaw today, Edgerley,”
she report back with eyes. “Of formerly
it used to be deliciously difficult to compel men
&amp; husbands to come to tea. Now you cannot
keep them away with weapons. Why is that
swift change?”</p>

<p>“When the tea goes out the tango’s in,” he
define, attempting to wear wit under his moustache.</p>

<p>It was very hard science to describe this tango-waltz
when I saw it, Mr. Editor. It are similar
to a minuet danced by eels. Angry elbows seem
to be slipping around everywheres while each
ladies and gentlemen seem to be walking sidewise
without intending to go there. Such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
chuckly movements of ducking away from music
amid bounces! Such clutch and jolt containing
great poetry! I could not unstand how persons
could do this American jiu-jitsu without injurious
breakage of their personality. And yet
no ambulance was called.</p>

<p>While I stood thusly composing thoughts,
Hon. Buttler walk to me with side-face moustache
similar to Hon. Chauncey Depew when
not joking.</p>

<p>“While you are doing nothing you should not
stand idly around,” he dib.</p>

<p>“You wish me dance also?” I snuggest.</p>

<p>“I wish you to go to royal reception door
downside and permit entrance to all calling
guests.” This he say with voice so expensive I
feel entirely bankrup.</p>

<p>So I go downside to reception door where I
set long-time for lonesome company by the knob.
Occasionately that music play so flirtatious that
my feet misbehave. Pretty soonly came ring-ring
to door. I admit. In come lengthwise gentleman
with Woodrow Wilson expression and
black-front necktie peculiar to clergy.</p>

<p>“What name, if any?” I ask to know. I made
my voice show insults peculiar to fashion.</p>

<p>“I am Rev. Mr. Scornaway, of St. Lucre
parish,” he deliver. “I have came to tea as
usual on Wedsday.”</p>

<p>“This is no place for a clergy,” I dictate warnfully.
“You can save your reputation by taking
it away with you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span></p>

<p>“What do you mean by your meaning?” he
snagger. “Do not Mrs. Vanderbitt Jones’s cards
say Tea on Wedsday?”</p>

<p>“This are not the kind of Wedsday you think
it is,” I abrupt.</p>

<p>“Poor benightied heathen!” he narrate.
“Have I not been arriving here for tea for the
last twenty (20) years since date when Hon.
Cyrus J. Jones was President of National Distrust
Co.? Have I not been here to talk church-work
with elderly ladies while setting down
amidst famus statesmen and talk on topics?
Have I not met most greatest dignity in America
within this house?”</p>

<p>“You will not meet them now,” I clabber, “or
if so they will be doing something else.”</p>

<p>“Pleasantly permit me to pass inside,” he
snarrel clergetically.</p>

<p>“O not to do!” I holla with Samurai knockles
preventing his forthstepping. “If I relate what
horror that tea is now doing you will not dare to
go inside with your profession.”</p>

<p>“Tell me the entire!” he commit bravely.</p>

<p>“They are making tango!” I whasper with
ears full of frights.</p>

<p>Hon. Rev. Mr. express great sternness in his
jaws like a reformer fighting Indians.</p>

<p>“Let me get at them!” he growell.</p>

<p>“O joyful!” I acknowledge. “Then you are
determined to stop it?”</p>

<p>“No!!” he gargle. “I am determined to
dance it!!!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span></p>

<p>I collapse backwards to setty chair and permit
him to advance to middle of music. For
13 1-8 minutes I remained stationary attempting
to fan away my faint. Then considerable
bashido filled my forehead and I leapt to my
footwear. Upstairs to dance-hall parlor I go.
There, surrounded by sidesteps, hand-clasps,
whirligig promenades, eye-gaze, romp, Vienna
tunes and acrobats I observed Hon. Rev. Mr.
circulating in clutch with Mrs. Vanderbitt Jones.
Determinely I advance to middle of and stand
befront them.</p>

<p>“Hon. Mrs. Madam, if conveniently—” I commence
to be interrupted.</p>

<p>“What is?” she require, continuing to circulate.</p>

<p>I am obliged to make delicious dance-motions
so I can keep up, yet I pursue near her.</p>

<p>“If convenient I quit,” is reprove for me. I
must now double three loops and whirl my arms
bias to remain next.</p>

<p>“Why you don’t quit without application to
me?” she ask it while 2-stepping.</p>

<p>“I wish tell you my feelings before departure,”
I reject while gliding my feet onwards and twining
my chest in stroggle to follow her closely.
“I shall not be a servant in such a fidgetty home.
I shock! What is becaming of America? Instead
of sipping tea, as formerly, they dance it.
Instead of enjoying sociability with brain they
do it with feet. They act midnight at five
o’clock. Preachers come to preach and stay to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
prance. Therefore, I remove myself to some
other jobs.”</p>

<p>“Jeems!” Hon. Mrs. holla to Hon. Buttler,
yet still continue fantango whirling, “here are
Japanese schoolboy who should be discharged to
music. Tango him down back steps.”</p>

<p>Nextly I knew I were embraced by that tense
Englishman without any H in his voice. While
music burst up into runaway tune, Hon. Buttler
show me tango so rapidly I did not know my
ears from my knuckles. O such musical scuttle-step,
back-walk, elbow-jounce, and twist-vine
movement towards outside side of house! And
there I suddenly arrived followed by orchestra-sound
including kick.</p>

<p>So I 1-step away with bursted gracefulness
peculiar to lame duck.</p>

<p>Hoping you are the same,</p>

<small>Are Turkey-Waltzing a Dance or a
Convulsion?</small></h2></div>


<p><i>To Editor N. Y. Newsprint, who must have
many subscribers because he know that where
there is Life there is Blood and where there is
Blood there is Circulation (free joke)</i></p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr.</span>:—The Japanese Patriotic and
Educational Suicide Club, of which I are
correspondent Secretary last night give a
waltzing cotillion and lemonade (25c for extra
ladies who drunk it) at Rising Sun Banzai Association
Hall. Considerable fashion of yellow
complexion was there with Sadikichi’s Brass
Orchestra to play it whenever we danced it.
Excitements.</p>

<p>Considerable Japanese schoolgirls was fetched
there by that nationality and I was deliciously
shocked to see how American they looked. They
wore crippled skirts of considerable thinness and
their shoulder blades seemed absolutely destitute.
I fetch Miss Ruby Fujimuto, Japanese lady of
aggrevated beauty, with me for escort. When
she removed off her opera-house cloak, I look at
her with my expression all braided up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span></p>

<p>“Ladies should be praised for their economy,”
I corrode while observing the cloth that was not
there.</p>

<p>She curbed up with bridle expression.</p>

<p>“You no like the way my neck is cut?” she
snagger, showing peevness by her soprano.</p>

<p>“Your neck is not cut,” I narrate. “I know
because I can see it all.”</p>

<p>She seem less engaged to me than formerly
and eloped away to make dance-step with J.
Haro, Japanese photographer.</p>

<p>Hon. Sadakichi’s Brass Orchestra make music
resembling roof gardens.</p>

<p>At that moment of time I could observe how
everybody was dancing. They seemed to be
jouncing in couples, making crowd-up walk with
occasional slouchy-slouchy motion while their
eyes said “How-do!” with Romeo expression
peculiar to Shakespeare.</p>

<p>“It are nice for youngly persons to be affectionate,”
I commute. “But when will dancing
begin?”</p>

<p>“They are now Turkey-waltzing,” depose
Arthur Kickahajama, missionary boy, with Tuxedo
eyebrows.</p>

<p>My cousin Nogi, who arrive there with Miss
Alice Sago (divorced) approach to me and wish
I should Turkey-waltz with her because he was
lame from when she kicked him. I told him I
was a Methodist heathen, therefore my feet was
too religious to dance.</p>

<p>“Turk-waltzing are denatured dancing,” arrange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
Miss Sago with alimony smiles. “Come,
Mr. Togo, I show you how do it!” So I went
and stroggled.</p>

<p>Mr. Editor, while I made gymnastix with that
charmed lady, I wished send you several editorials.
What are this Turkey-Waltz, I ask to
know? Were it invented by Turks at Adrianople
while wrastling with the Vulgarian army? Did
Turkish soldiers think up that peculiarostous
step while rolling barrels of powder at Greece?
Why should persons blame Turks with this style
of trotting if they never did it? Mohammedans
has got sifficient bad habits of their own without
accusing them of some more!</p>

<p>This Miss Sago shove me here &amp; elsewhere
with neglectful expression peculiar to roustabouts.
When music play “All Persons Are
Doing Something” she attemp to dissociate my
spine by wig-wagging my elbows.</p>

<p>“Make your ankles more diagonal!” she declare
with sweety schoolteacher face. I wish to
ask her marry me, but wondered what might
happen if I did. I make slight jiu jitsu to
her wrist, but she got more stronger grippe
while I jounce alternately like tables in earthquakes.</p>

<p>“My feet are filled with clumsies,” I narrate
baffably.</p>

<p>“That are very valuable in Turk-trotting,” she
say for sweetly smiling.</p>

<p>“So is?” I holla. “I always sipposed folks
must be graceful to make dance step.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span></p>

<p>“They ust to, but no more,” she expose. “All
fashionable 400s today when dancing considers
it great elegance to appear like drunken sailors
wrestling with bears.”</p>

<p>I should have responded to her educational
catalogue, but she was showing me new jag-step
where I could elevate my knees to music while
being choked.</p>

<p>“I will nextly show you how do the Jellyfish
Crawl,” she pronounce with Tipsichore expression.</p>

<p>“If I learned any more dances I should become
a Geisha, which are less proper,” I renig
shyly while eloping away from her armful with
talented dodges.</p>

<p>When I was hiding behind palum trees where
she could not see me I watched considerable turkey-trottery,
bunny-huggery, etc., with eyes full
of science. Dignified home-made Japanese was
making roof-garden loops with their legs in such
a way their wife &amp; children would feel siprised.
Arthur Kickahajama, missionary boy, were doing
sidewise catch-and-let-go dance with Miss
Mamie Furaoki. After that actions I could not
see how he ever could look a Y. M. C. A. in the
face again. First they glid together with expression
of happy crabs, then they made a twillup,
two cross-legs &amp; 3 bounces. This was followed
by clutches.</p>

<p>“They are dancing Tango,” pronounce Sydney
Katsu, Jr., who was floorwalking like a committee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span></p>

<p>“What slum teaches persons dance like that?”
I abject doggishly.</p>

<p>“Sometimes Bowery, sometimes Fifth Avenue,”
he report for tone of high-social.</p>

<p>“Do Fifth Avenue permit the Bowery to
teach them depravity?” I require.</p>

<p>“Ah no!” ollicute Sydney. “Fifth Avenue
are teaching the Bowery. Vices are like other
kinds of furniture. Rich folks uses them first
and only pass them on to poor folks when they
are second hand. Thusly the slums are seldom
safe.”</p>

<p>“After Tango is finished what new dance will
explode in the Smarty Set?” are next question
for me.</p>

<p>“Not sure,” Sydney say so with Harry Leer
eyebrows. “Last week I hear how some high-style
Newporters had gone to Africa for try
dancing with some cannibles what knew some
deliciously low down steps. But after the first
dance they had to quit because they was
ashamed.”</p>

<p>“Who was ashamed—the Newporters?”</p>

<p>“No, the cannibles,” notate Sydney Katsu,
Jr., looking like he was prepared to be raided by
police.</p>

<small>When Will Lady-Fashions Get
Ashamed of Themselves?</small></h2></div>


<p><i>To Editor N. Y. Newsprint or whoever
prints it</i></p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:—Of lately I have been studying
American style of fashions for ladies,
so I shall know your civilization from
both ends. It are a very hard science to chase
and in doing so I annexed my acquaintance to
Miss Alice Furaoki, to who I shall become engaged
when divorced. This sweet-hearted Japanese
schoolgirl dress so similar to American
actresses you cannot tell her from white lady, except
when you look at her.</p>

<p>Last Satday eve p.m., when I was accomplishing
her down street for see emotion-picture show,
price 10c, I felt very Vanderbiltish to walk
so near to Newport dressmaking. My eye
hooked itself to her clothing and remained there
till—O sudden!—I observe what was. I blushed
entirely yellow.</p>

<p>“Excuse, please, Hon. Miss Sweetheart,” I
gollup. “Your dressmake has axidentally forgot
to sew up the ankle of your skirt so I observe
something deranged.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span></p>

<p>“What derangement do you observe?” she require
with Vassar eyebrows.</p>

<p>“Not sure,” I stotter. “It seems to resemble
the biceps of your hosiery.”</p>

<p>“That biceps is situated where it usually is,”
she otter clamly like an ice box.</p>

<p>“Should it be ashamed?” I ask shockly.</p>

<p>“It are style,” she decry, “and style are never
ashamed. Togo, why should you stand there
gasping like Queen Victoria seeing Paris? This
garments I are wearing are called a gashed skirt
and is now very favorite at Newport, and Jewport,
on Fifth &amp; Sixth Avenues. Queen Mary
of London wore one (very slightly) while giving
Ice Cream Social to Knights of the Garter. In
Paris it were even more so, as usual. Two
French countesses from Minneapolis appeared
tired out in this costume at Long Chumps race-course
and everybody was so asphyxiated by
charm they forgot to lose their money.”</p>

<p>“Horses must feel very slow when racing
against such style,” I report nervely. “I am
alarmed to think to where fashions will jump to
nextly.”</p>

<p>“More will soonly explode from Vienna where
a gentleman-dressmake have invented a dress all
of glass,” she narrate with smiling eyebrows.
“It will be worn in beautiful green shades.”</p>

<p>“Green shades are necessary to pull down
sometimes when you are living in glass clothing,”
I say so for Elbert Hubbard smartness.</p>

<p>Miss Furaoki make no intellectual reply, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
we arrive inside emotion-picture show to see that
noiseless opera. I think I shall marry her sooner
than ever.</p>

<p>Mr. Editor, Hon. Anthony Comestop and
other celebrated purities is continuously complaining
because female ladies is becoming too
much seen in public places. Women is becoming
too brave and their skirts too shrinking.
Hon. Comestop, who are not so strong as he
were before he took up modesty as a business,
fainted 2½ times when he seen photos of Lady
Bluff-Gorgon’s latest style-simpony entitled
“Spring Twilight” and he have ordered entire
U. S. Army to encamp at Custom House to stop
it when she send over Fall-style walking-suit
called “September Morn.”</p>

<p>Considerable ministers, judges and boss policemen
has been talking like angry uncles to ladies
because of the increasing decrease of their clothing.
I read in news-print last week how Hon.
Judge Killjoy of Salem, Mass., wish to burn all
witches under 27 years of age for bewitching
gentlemen by the clothes they don’t wear. Last
week he order Hon. Police to grabb all ladies
wearing dangerous skirts, but Hon. Police were
too lazy to arrest entire female population, so he
brought Village Belle into court, because she
looked most so.</p>

<p>Hon. Judge observe that lady’s clingstone appearance
and put on eye-spectacles, because must
see careful.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Madam,” he report legally like Hon.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
Taft, “I are not astonished that there are such
delicious quantities of Cubist artists in this generation.
They are the only artists which can
paint modern ladydress so it conceals them sifficiently.”</p>

<p>“Do you not like what I got on?” she require.</p>

<p>“I do not object to such smallish matters,” he
negligee. “It is for the absent that I mourn.”</p>

<p>“I are dressed in style,” she dib feminitely.</p>

<p>“You are dressed in very little else,” he legalize.
“I should die of shames if I should see my
Wife promenading in street clad in such a lack.”</p>

<p>“I do not blame you,” she snagger snubbishly.
“I once saw your Wife in bathing suit and can
sympathize with you.”</p>

<p>Hon. Judge feel considable contempt of court
for this remark, yet he could not hang her, because
her style had not killed anybody yet.</p>

<p>“Who is it buys the purchase of your wardrobe,
such as is?” he ask to know.</p>

<p>“My husband,” she pronounce.</p>

<p>“I shall arrest him for failure to provide,” he
renig hashly. So he lock up court in time to go
codfish.</p>

<p>Mr. Editor, numberous reformers is making
weep-voice because ladies is coming out in worse
&amp; worse. Yet I are less alarmed. Styles is like
other forms of advertisement—they are made to
create look-at, and when this stop, they stop also.
Ladyfashions is always worse than formerly, yet
never so bad as they was. If you think 1913 is
hideolous, look at 1880; if you think that ugliferous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>,
observe 1870. Before the Uncivil War considerable
preachers made considerable shock because
ladies wore their lingeries next to their
shoes. In reign of Gen. Arthur gentlemen enjoyed
much sorrow because ladies wore their
skirts in Psyche knots behind their backs. And
now they create peev because ladies does not
wear sifficiently enough anywheres.</p>

<p>At what periodical time of civilization have
not mankind scolded ladykind for something she
took on or put off? You would think from how
they act that gentlemen must detest ladies for
looking so homely. Yet suicide, divorce &amp; population
increases annually, which show that ladies
can never dress too fashionable to be loved by
someone.</p>

<small>The Drama of Sex</small></h2></div>


<p><i>To Editor N. Y. Newsprint who knows how
to go too far without arriving there.</i></p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Dearest Sir</span>:—My Aunt Taki Kati,
spinsterial suffragette from Kobe, Japan,
arrived here of recently and say she should
like see all the customs of America.</p>

<p>“What you wish see firstly?” I require for
guide-bookish expression.</p>

<p>“Theater,” she say so.</p>

<p>“Had we not better begin with some other
slum first?” I ask out. “There are some delicious
gunmen in jail this week; Tammany Hall
are still open to tourists and I could show you
some splandid opium smokeries in Chinatown,
price 25c.”</p>

<p>“Why should I not see theater first?” she
require with Pankhurst eyebrows.</p>

<p>“Because so,” I report. “To enjoy theater
you should a proach it gradually like any other
bad habit. It are better to work up from mild
to more strong. Otherwisely you might become
ill without feeling intoxicated. Foreigners intending
to see American theaters should first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
take lessons in blonde-slavery, debutchery, gun-manliness
and o. u. kiddery. Then they can
see dramatic arts without blushing too much.”</p>

<p>“My stumach has been strengthened by hunger
strikes,” say that suffraging Japanese.
“Therefore I can stand considerable endurance.”</p>

<p>“What variety play you wish observe?” I
say it.</p>

<p>“Some simple domesticated drama,” she indicate.
So we went forthly for see what was.</p>

<p>Mr. Editor, when we approach Broadway that
street seem about like usual. Breathing get more
difficulty there all time, because so many new
theaters arise there each night, making fresh air
umpossible.</p>

<p>“I smell the odor of some smell,” narrate my
dear Aunt with chokes.</p>

<p>“There is several new Viennese plots in town,”
I say so.</p>

<p>While we walked we could see following flashing
signs winking with wicked electricity:</p>

<p class="narrow">
<span class="smcap">Countess Nymphia<br />
By Swineburg<br />
Openly Vicious!!</span><br />
</p>

<p>Next sign report:</p>

<p class="narrow">
<span class="smcap">The Girl and the Libertine<br />
A Horrible Hit!!</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span></p>

<p>Next theater divulge:</p>

<p class="narrow">
<span class="smcap">Slightly Soiled<br />
The Drama of Disease!!</span><br />
</p>

<p>Nearby electricity say:</p>

<p class="narrow">
<span class="smcap">The White Slave’s Frolic<br />
Modern Musical Comedy<br />
100 Shocking Songs!!</span><br />
</p>

<p>My Aunt Taki Kati wish see this opera, because
she admire Gilbert &amp; Sullivan for their
tunes. So we go Box Office and ask buy sit-down
inside.</p>

<p>“We do not sell tickets,” he reply peevly.
“Ain’t you got sifficient brains in your mind to
go to speculator when buying tickets?”</p>

<p>We find Hon. Speculator by sidewalk looking
quite commercial.</p>

<p>“10$ each,” he report with tickets.</p>

<p>“Why should your price be so immodest?”
I snagger.</p>

<p>“This are an immodest play,” he snudge.
“Also we must charge extra for this performance
because the author will be arrested after
Act II.”</p>

<p>I knew we could see just a.m.ch wickedness
for less cash money, so we walk onwards. On
side-up street we see sign which say:</p>

<p class="narrow">
<span class="smcap">The Limit!<br />
Abundantly Worst!!</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span></p>

<p>At this play we obtain sitting-room price 3$
each, which were deliciously cheap for so much
sin. When we got inside there I obtain program,
which was useless for my Aunt Taki, who do
not understand American language, but can
blush plenty in Japanese. Following words was
on program:</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Evil Characters Represented</i></p>

<table class="autotable" summary="">
<tr>
<td class="tdl">J. W. Wineblower</td>
<td class="tdr">Vice-President of Vice Trust</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Mrs. Lillian Lorelei</td>
<td class="tdr">A Temptation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Venus</td>
<td class="tdr">A poor shop girl</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>There was many others on that program which
I did not have time to see because Hon. Curtain
go uply amidst Rector music. The scenery was
red like it was blushing for itself. And there
sat Hon. Mrs. Lorelei removing shoes while
smoking opium. Pretty soonly one of her husbands
encroach in and complain that Hon. Janitor
has been putting too much water in his morphine
this week. Knock-knock by door. Hon.
Police arrive in and accept bribery. Amidst
considerable talk about purity Hon. Miss Venus
arrive in and say she cannot obtain sifficient vice
for 4$ weekly in department store where she
work. Therefore she have come. I shall tell you
the rest when I can whisper....</p>

<p>Mr. Editor, when Act I were finished up my
Aunt Taki Kati smell a bottle of Japanese salts
for take the taste out of her nose. She say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
that if America was like this Japan must annex
it before it decayed. She say her oldmaidenhood
were insulted by that sight and she was sure
she must die dead from shocks.</p>

<p>“Maybe we better go outside for ventilated
air,” I snuggest.</p>

<p>“Ah no!” she otter. “Let me faint where
I am. If I went out I might lose my seat.”</p>

<p>But I feel otherwisely. I would rather drink
my beer in some saloon where thoughts are more
pure. So I elope outside, leaving Hon. Aunt to
shock by herself. There was so many Presbyterian
clergymans coming inward that I was
nearly scrunshed in going outward. Yet I manage
to get to lobbed door outside.</p>

<p>By Boxed Office I notice Hon. Moses Feldspar,
the management, talking to Chief of Police
and other press agents.</p>

<p>“You are less ashamed than formerly,” I narrate
hashly.</p>

<p>“Why should I feel ashamed of employing
Truth among my actresses?” he snagger.</p>

<p>“I never saw Truth behave so careless!” I
dib.</p>

<p>“She are most truthful when naked,” he exclam.</p>

<p>“She are,” I renig for scorns. “But when
Hon. Stage Manager dress her in X ray skirt she
appear entirely dishonest.”</p>

<small>Grand Opera in English</small></h2></div>


<p><i>To Editor N. Y. Newsprint who can be considerable
comical without music</i>,</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Dearest Sir</span>:—Cousin Nogi report to
me recently with Oscar Hammerstein
eyebrows.</p>

<p>“Togo,” he say so, “cannot grand opera be
equally grand when pronounced in English?”</p>

<p>“Frequent theaters is now doing so with help
of talented soprano,” I say it.</p>

<p>“So glad to hear!” contuse my cousin.
“Nextly they will be singing Salome in Japanese,
which will be nice education for Japan who
wish to be educated so quickly possible, yet like
to know what they are talking about while doing
so. Now they can’t do, thank you. Of recently
famous sing-song play ‘Carmen’ were introduced
in Yeddo. Considerable confusion enjoyed.
When Hon. Bullfighter emerge forth
from slaughterhouse yalling ‘Tor-ee-a-do-da!’ in elevator voice, all Japanese thinkers present
imagine it was New York scenery describing
Tammany Hall after election while Hon. Jno. P.
Mitchel were congratulating himself on cruelty
to tigers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span></p>

<p>“While grand opera is in English all persons
can understand merely by ear,” I nudge gladly.</p>

<p>“Will not German language lose its health if
translated?” require Cousin Nogi.</p>

<p>“Perhapsly,” I collapse. “American language
have no beautiful words like ‘lustspiel’ and
‘Sauerbraten.’ Yet maybe they could use some
baseball language so all could seem natural.”</p>

<p>“At any rates,” say Nogi, “it must be entirely
enjoyous sensation to set in opera and know
what they are talking.”</p>

<p>“Let us go and try one,” I snuggest with
happy hat.</p>

<p>So we sonter forthly until we observe theater
what say “Grand Opera—English Spoken here.”
We encroach to door where bull-board pronounce,
“Opera Longrin by Hans Wagner,
Famus Cyclist.”</p>

<p>Annexed to door-entrance stood one stylish
bell-boy who hold slight program in his thumbs.</p>

<p>“All words to opera 25c!” he pronounce distinctually.</p>

<p>“Why must we spent this ¼$ for words,
please?” I ask to know.</p>

<p>“So understand what stage-singers say,” report
boy containing buttons.</p>

<p>“Do they not say it in English?” I negotiate
peevly.</p>

<p>“Not sure,” say Hon. Boy. “I have only been
here a week.”</p>

<p>We step inwards and observe opera going
ahead amid considerable crashes. I heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
“Ouch!” while I set down, but was not sure
whether it was orchestra or merely lady I stepped
on.</p>

<p>Hon. Stage was filled with scenery, people &amp;
tragedy. I could not tell what that picture represent,
but it were easy to see who was there.
King Leopold of Belgium in antique bathrobe
were surrounded by German Samurai on bright
banks of Erie Canal where they go for fresh air
while being cruel in music. Hon. King grumble
some dishagreeable barytones to goldly-hair
daughter who step forthly in rich nightgown &amp;
holla,</p>

<p>“O wat di spa!”</p>

<p>I turn to eye-glass gentleman next by me who
were reading Book of Opera with piano-tuner
expression.</p>

<p>“What she mean when she say, ‘O wat di
spa!” I requesh.</p>

<p>“She say, ‘O what despair!” he pronounce
distinctually.</p>

<p>“What language was that, please?” This
from me.</p>

<p>“English,” he whisper peevly.</p>

<p>“I am glad to make its acquaintance,” I argue
slightly.</p>

<p>Pretty soonly, after considerable choir-noise,
Hon. Orchestra get into dispute with brass
horners. And look, see! Down wet transportation
of Erie Canal come flotting one enormalously
swollen duck and on him stands riding one hansum
circus man in tin clothes. Excitements.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
Hon. Tin Gentleman get off from that trained
white chicken and throw hitching-rope around
his stretched neck. Hon. Poultry bobb chin with
peck-peck expression and steam away with
promptness peculiar to commutation. Hon. Tin
Hero wave muscles of fingers.</p>

<p>“Feh-wa! Feh-wa! Ma fayvu swa!” he warbule
with sweet lung.</p>

<p>I turn to Hon. Eye-Glass next by me who still
read Opera Book.</p>

<p>“What was he said it?” I require chivalrously.</p>

<p>“He say, ‘Farewell, farewell, my faithful
swan!’” he snub maddishly.</p>

<p>“Are he still talking English?” I narrate.</p>

<p>“Hush it!” he snarrel. “Between your noise
and the orchestra I cannot hear the opera.”</p>

<p>“If my absence will make this art easier for
your mentality I shall cease to blockade,” are
sharp report I make while withdrawing Cousin
Nogi outside the theater.</p>

<p>Although Nagasaki by birth, I am Glasgow in
my soul, Mr. Editor. It pangs me to spend
money without some come-back for what I pay.</p>

<p>So I enrush up to box-office with money-back
expression.</p>

<p>“I require get at leastly 35c return rebate on
these stubbed tickets,” I say so to merely financial
gentleman who was there.</p>

<p>“Why for?” dib Box Officer hashly.</p>

<p>“Because is!” I reject scornly. “I pay large
wealth to hear English. What they sung was
otherwise.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span></p>

<p>“That were English!” say Money Box.</p>

<p>“I could not understand it.” Say me.</p>

<p>“Nobody expect understood Grand Opera in
any language,” he snagger. “Be reasonable like
Sherman Law.”</p>

<p>“What are grand opera for, if not?” I ask
to know.</p>

<p>“Several things. To give folks wrong impression
of history and confuse them about love
while admiring Smart Setters in diamond horseshoe,”
he define. “This has satisfied Art for
311 years—why should you require something
else all of a sudden?”</p>

<p>“Then why would it not be just as good for
Americans if sung in Chinese, Swedish or German?”
I negotiate.</p>

<p>“Because of patriotism,” he define. “Every
man prefer to be puzzled in his own language.”</p>

<small>A Lesson in Eugenics</small></h2></div>


<p><i>To Editor N. Y. Newsprint, who will please
be more careful about choosing his ancestors in
the future</i>,</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:—Last Wedsday night I got
feeling of lonesome matrimony, so I put
on Tuxedo slippers and necktie resembling
Vogue. I was not sure which lady I intended
for marry, but I go see Miss Tessie
Matsuki because I could get there without carfare.
This Matsuki lady live over store of her
father, Hon. J. W. Matsuki, Japanese hay &amp;
grain. She got considerable Vassar intelligence
and would make nice wife for librarian.</p>

<p>I found her by lamplight wearing goldly spectacles
while reading enlarged volume entitle
“Eugenic.”</p>

<p>She felt my biceps while shaking hands &amp;
seem to examine my hair for criminal traits. I
ask her would she like go see emotion picture
show with my accompaniment. She say no. She
prefer set stationary and talk about Future Race.
I explan that I did not keep up pretty well with
sporty events, but my Cousin Nogi were entirely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
educated about racing &amp; baseball. She give high-up
laugh of culture.</p>

<p>“Future Race are not sporty event,” she define.
“It are Eugenic.”</p>

<p>“I got no time to think foreign languages,”
I say so while admiring her sweethearted expression
with Garden of Allah sensation. “I come
here to ask some big importance. Would it be
convenient to get married?”</p>

<p>“It would be no trouble however,” she report
for smiling.</p>

<p>“O then we shall!” I holla while attempting
to hold her handclasp, but she snatch it to herself.</p>

<p>“If suitable I shall include you on waiting
list,” she snuggest.</p>

<p>“I present you my heart,” I renig for poetry.</p>

<p>“Condition of lung are more important,” she
renounce. “Let me hear your deep breathing.”
I do so. She listen. “Ah!! I suspected what I
supposed! Your left pulmonia has slight
anachronism. How dare you love me?”</p>

<p>“Permit me to tell about myself!” I yall like
Romeo.</p>

<p>“Tell me about your grandfather, instead,”
she abrupt.</p>

<p>“I do not ask you marry my grandfather.”
This from me while enjoying slight agonies.</p>

<p>“In Eugenic,” she report, “we are expected
to marry entire family.”</p>

<p>“This Eugene must come from Utah,” I snib.
“My grandfather would not permit such illegality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>.
He were married once, which were too
many. Also he are dead. It are immoral to
marry dead folks.”</p>

<p>“What he die from?” she romp forth.</p>

<p>“Asthma of knees,” I pronounce.</p>

<p>“So ha! Then you got diseases in family!”</p>

<p>“You expect my ancestors to die from being
too healthy?” I ask to know. “Perhapsly Hon.
Eugene who wrote that book will teach us how
to do so.”</p>

<p>“He expects to arrange everything,” she compose
proudishly. “His speciality will be marriage.
Youngly persons will be selected carefully
like Luther Burbank choose best potatoes for
crop.”</p>

<p>“Will this Hon. Eugene make some new marriage
ceremony?” I otter.</p>

<p>“That have been arrange also,” she tell.
“When 2 Eugeniuses wish get married following
program will be enjoyed:</p>

<p>“Joy-bells will be jungled from tip-top of
gymnasium where members of Board of Health
will act as Ushers, admitting relatives after examining
their tonsils. Talented vaudeville performers
will play ‘Weddlesohn’s Mending
March’ on Indian clubs while Bride &amp; Bridebroom,
wearing Annit Kellerman bathing suits to
show no deception had been concealed, will walk
up aisle hand-in-hand with parents wearing rubber
gloves. Bride must not blush, because that
are sign of weak heart and Bridebroom must not
seem nervus, because that indicate tendency to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
allipeptic fits. After dumb-bell drill Rev.
Preacher will step uply.”</p>

<p>“What Rev. Preacher will do this ceremony?”
I inquest.</p>

<p>“Not sure,” she negotiate. “Perhaps Rev.
Billy Sunday might do, because of muscular religion.”</p>

<p>“What shall this marriage service say?” is
next question for me.</p>

<p>“It say following dialog:</p>

<p>Rev. Mr.——, Do you love this woman?</p>

<p>Bridebroom—No.</p>

<p>Rev. Mr.——, Woman, you love this man?</p>

<p>Bride—No.</p>

<p>Rev. Mr.—— Good. You have no inherited
instinct. You swear there is no fits, insanity or
general ability in family? (They swear.)</p>

<p>Then stick out tongues, please. That will do,
thank you. I make you manandwife.”</p>

<p>Miss Tessie Matsuki look to me reproachly
when saying this.</p>

<p>“What happen pretty soonly after marriage?”
I snuggest.</p>

<p>“Baby,” she pronounce. “He are born perfect
without a blamish or any other sign of humanity.
He are gave perfectly balanced name
like Sandow Socrates Shakespeare Scagg. In
babyhood he are never kissed. In schoolday he
are never spanked. In manhood he are never
loved. And so he grow upward.”</p>

<p>“What do he become, after so much exercise—a
Congressman, perhapsly?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span></p>

<p>“How could he? Congressman are noted for
imperfection.”</p>

<p>“Then perhapsly he would be novelist or play-right?”</p>

<p>“Ah never yet!” she snatch. “How could
perfect Man be connected in trade with
Jack London, Gus Thomas and other rough
boys?”</p>

<p>“Yet there might be some jobs for him. He
could be machinery engineer of prominent greatness.”</p>

<p>“Not possibly!” she reject. “Should we permit
such model gentleman to build subways for
political scandals?”</p>

<p>“But this Eugenics Baby must choose some
activity of work. Shall he be too good for any
profession when grown up?”</p>

<p>“Indeed will!” she holla. “He will be a
Father.”</p>

<p>“Father of what?” I require with alarmed
teeth.</p>

<p>“Of children similar to himself.”</p>

<p>“Miss Tessie Matsuki,” I denominate punctually
while choosing my hat from table, “excuse
my escape. I wish for search out some
young lady who will prove her unfitness to marry
by falling in love. Please excuse!”</p>

<p>“Uncivilized brain!” she snarrel. “Go
forthly! Such depraved minds like yours drive
tacks into the feet of Science when he try to
progress. And yet the world do move, in spite
of Tammany Hall.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span></p>

<p>“Tammany Hall also move occasionally,” I
corrode with Fusion expression.</p>

<p>So I elope away full of low character.</p>

<small>Togo’s Christmas Day in the Morning</small></h2></div>


<p><i>To Editor Good Housekeep Magazine who
realize how it must be more expensive to give
than to receive.</i></p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Sir</span>:—Merry Xmas thoughts
fill me with something else. My brain
refuse to ring bells in connection with this
annual jingling. Perhapsly it is because of following
anecdote which happen to me:</p>

<p>At home of Mrs. &amp; Mr. J. Poke, Rockpile,
N. J., which is on the list of places where I am
no longer there, I was employed in their midst.
That family contained only two (2) complete
children, but they were sifficiently plenty. By
name they was Hester and Lester, aged 5 &amp; 7
respectfully. These youngly persons, when
healthy, was full of childly amusements including
dish-break, runaway, knockabouts, and whittling
pensils with Father’s safety razor.</p>

<p>But by approach of Xmas time they suddenly
became otherwise. I notice this because I seen
it. They walk around with Y. M. C. A. expression
of toes and seem too good to be happy.</p>

<p>“Oh childish children!” I require from them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
“why so you do so? Do you enjoy some sleeping
sickness to make you thusly silent?”</p>

<p>“Hush it!” they depose. “Xmas are coming!”</p>

<p>“Are Xmas, then, such saddish event that you
should await it without cheers?” I ask to
know.</p>

<p>“Oh, not is!” they ollicute. “But, unless we
behave very Sunday-school, Hon. St. Claus will
not arrive with gifts of great cash valuation.”</p>

<p>I stand gast for this phenominal. So I go to
Hon. Mrs. Poke and require from her, “Hon.
Mrs. Madam,” I say so, “who are this Hon. St.
Claus who seem so Carnegie in his gifts?”</p>

<p>“He resemble Hon. Doc Cook,” she snuggest,
with slyly winking. “No such person ever was.”</p>

<p>“How so!” I snatch off for horrors. “Then
I must inform Hon. Hester &amp; Lester about this
mistaken personality.”</p>

<p>“Not to do!” she snagger peevly.</p>

<p>“Why should not?” I ask to know, with
eyebrows.</p>

<p>“Because thus,” she say it. “I told them
about this Hon. St. Claus from my own voice.”</p>

<p>“How you could be so deceptive?” I terrify.</p>

<p>“I do this to make my children less sinful in
their comportment,” she snuggest. “When they
go around making gunman noises, I holla, ‘Stop
before Hon. St Claus hear you and refuse to
come!’ If they tell untruthful lies, I humiliate
them by reproaching, ‘Hon St Claus will snub
you for this untruthfulness!’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span></p>

<p>“Honesty are nice exercise for children to
learn,” I corrode.</p>

<p>She make pleasant face for reply.</p>

<p>“On Xmas night-before,” she explan, “me &amp;
Hon. Mr. Poke set up slight candle-tree in dining-room.
We cluster this foliage with ornaments
to resemble circus, and by foot of it we place
extended quantities of drums, guns, horns, cannons,
velocipedes, baseballs and other tools with
which home can be broke. In dawn-break of
morning Hon. Dear Children come down and
observe. ‘Who sent it?’ they require. ‘Hon.
St Claus bring it because you was truthful childs,’ we report. ‘How he get in?’ they ask to know.
‘He slid down chimbley-pipe,’ we say back deceptively.
So merry Xmas is enjoyed by all.”</p>

<p>“Are it not somewhat sinful to relate them
fibbulous tale to tender child?” I negotiate.</p>

<p>“Ah, no!” she abstract. “If childhood
should not believe in St Claus, then most happy
times would relapse forever. Togo, you must
do everything what possible to make them believe
in this whisker-gentleman.”</p>

<p>“I shall attempt to think up something deliciously
deceptive,” are smart answer I make.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As Xmas date approach up, Hon. Hester &amp;
Lester become more fidgettous in their psychology.</p>

<p>“This morning I dishcover 6 boxes labeled
‘Smith’s Toy Store’ in basement of cellar,” pronounce
Hon. Lester. “What could be in it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span></p>

<p>“Coal is frequently packed in toy-boxes,” I
renounce.</p>

<p>“It look very deceptive to me,” deploy infant
Hester.</p>

<p>“At times I are discouraged about St Claus,”
narrate Hon. Lester.</p>

<p>“So sinful thought!” I holla.</p>

<p>“How could I believe in gentleman I never
seen? Where is his photo? I suspect.”</p>

<p>“Many distinguished persons is shy about
photos,” I abrupt.</p>

<p>“Perhapsly,” aggrevate Hon. Lester. “Yet
other things I cannot understand with brain.
Hon. Parents tell me how Hon. St Claus comes
sliding down chimbley-pipe with gifts. I have
awaited many nights to observe this downfall,
yet he never come. Therefore he ain’t.”</p>

<p>“If you should seen him make in-shoot by
chimbley-pipe, would you believe this whiskered
fairy?” I ask it.</p>

<p>“Oh, surely yes!” response Hester &amp; Lester
together like chorus girls.</p>

<p>“Then on Xmas morning you shall observe
him!” I abrogate with earnest expression of
teeth.</p>

<p>On date previously before Xmas I go to town-village
with weekly salary, price $5, and purchase
considerable wheel-cart, squeak-doll, jump-up-Jack,
and other childish amusement. These I
poke under overcoat and retreat home slyly like
snails walking over upholstery.</p>

<p>When night time was there, Hon. Hester &amp;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
Lester was cruelly sent to bedtime and locked
asleep so they would not find out about Hon. St
Claus. As soonly as they make sleep, Mrs. &amp; Mr.
Poke command me for bring forth Xmas-tree. I
make him grow from soap-box in dining-room. I
assist intelligently hanging this foliage with tin
fruit, including numberous candles standing on
limbs to resemble candy fireworks. While Hon.
Poke boss my enthusiasm, I fetch forth considerable
heavy toy-boxes from basement of cellar.
Back-broke feelings by me. Yet I continue this
labors until mixed assortment of Xmas stood by
tree with deceptive labels about Hon. St Claus.</p>

<p>At 1 o’clock hour a.m. Mrs. and Mr. retire
bedward, exhausted from observing my work.
But my dutiful labors had just commenced. I
must prepare to show those childish children
how Hon. Mr. Claus down-slide down chimbley-pipe.</p>

<p>All house was full of darkness. Frozen moonlight
outside. With sneekret feetsteps, like
snakes swimming in oil, I approach to closet and
fetch forth following articles of clothes:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 minkish ottomobile coat</li>
<li>2 boots of rubberly exterior</li>
<li>1 cap from Eskimo leather</li>
<li>½ lb cotton resembling whisker.</li>
</ul>

<p>I drop all them presents I bought inside one
laundry-bag, place myself into those garments of
clothes, then with detective toes I descend up
through attric to where chimbley-pipe was on
roof.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span></p>

<p>4 o’clock time now approach. Making affectionate
hugs to Hon. Chimbley, I could tell it was
Xmas by the feel of the themometer. By peeking
down Hon. Chimbley, I could see how it was
sifficiently large hole to permit my Japanese
smallness—yet I must compress myself to do so.
I enjoyed considerable nervusness like heroes expecting
to dive down Mt. Vesuvius.</p>

<p>Pretty soonly 6 a.m. was there and I was not
yet froze completely hard. By listening down
chimbley-pipe with telephone expression, I could
hear childhood voices coming down-stairs saying
“Oh!!” It were time for me to make some
slide.</p>

<p>I pull ½lb cotton to my chin, snuggle Hon.
Bag to back, and commence climbing into
chimbley. What was? Distinctually I could
smell slight smudj of smoke coming upwards!
Yet it were too late. Already I was slipping,
down-sliding slowly. Great chokes enjoyed.
When nearly down I stuck up suddenly. More
chokes.</p>

<p>“Oh, hellup, hellup!” I gollup.</p>

<p>“Who there?” demand Hon. Poke below-down.</p>

<p>“Hon. St Claus containing smoke!” I yellup.
“Make haste or else be quick!”</p>

<p>Some individual persons grabb me at toes.
With intense drag I was pulled forth to fireplace
where blazes was. My cottonly whisker
become inflamed, and in desperado attempt I
clash against Xmas-tree which tottle over amidst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
horble fire-alarms. Great holla by all. Then I
am a hero, as usual. While all others make
hook-and-ladder noise, I embrace Hon. Tree
with elbows and reject him outwards through
window. Of finally all was silent, except slight
smell of smudj.</p>

<p>“What impossibility are you attempting to act
like?” require Hon. Mrs. sarcastly.</p>

<p>“Hon. St Claus,” I report.</p>

<p>“Why you no entrance by door?” shreech
Hon. Mr. with wounded knuckle.</p>

<p>“Doors is not respectable for Saints to come
in by,” I devote.</p>

<p>“They are plenty for Japanese to go out by,”
resnort him, escorting me outwards with brutal
jam.</p>

<p>And when I was deploying away from there I
hear Hester &amp; Lester report in voice together:</p>

<p>“We have saw Hon. St Claus. We do not
care to meet such a person!”</p>

<p>So I depart off feeling like an umpossibility.</p>

<p>Hoping you are the same,</p>

<small>The Head of the House</small></h2></div>


<p><i>To Editor Good Housekeeping Magazine,
civilized personality who knows everything about
home except what goes on</i>,</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:—Last place from which I was
rebounded were home of Mrs. &amp; Mr. Annette
Pratt, Curfew Glen, N. J. These
individuals, though not peculiar from themselves,
had home-names what distincted them entirely.
Hon. Mrs. Pratt was Mother Love, Hon. Mr.
Pratt was Father Darling and Hon. Daughter
Pratt was Mabel Dear. This Mabel Dear was
half-past schoolgirl age. She enjoy such aggrevated
health that her mother make considerable
worry for her.</p>

<p>“Why should not Mabel Dear help Togo make
housework?” require Hon. Husband while seeing
her idly resting.</p>

<p>“She must enjoy her headaches each morning
during housekeep hours,” snuggest Mother Love.
“It are fashionable to be illhealthy until noon.”</p>

<p>“Her illhealthiness do not keep her from tennis-play,
night-set-up, tango &amp; flirtating which
she do considerable,” commute Hon. Him with
grouches in his voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span></p>

<p>“Fortunately she can accomplish slight duties
expected of any high-bread girl,” gollup Hon.
Mrs.</p>

<p>“When I was boy my mother knew nothing
about Vermin Castle dance, yet she could make
doughnut, quilt, soap, beds and many other delicious
home cooking,” he glub.</p>

<p>“Father Darling,” yellup Mabel Dear from
her sofa where she layed with her fatigue,
“Mother Love says I can have new Harper’s
Bazar dress for Judkins-Perkins wedding festival
ball.”</p>

<p>“I am too busy going to my office!” he snarrel
while departing with door.</p>

<p>This Mabel Dear are Miss Lady of such great
importantness that it give me great sorrow of
brain to think she was born to merely New Jersey
condition of real estate. When Hon. Father
pass off she tell this sadness to her mother.</p>

<p>“Mother Love,” she say so, “it create considerable
humility in my prides for see Togo
open doors with soapsuds thumbs when Hon.
Percy Twill, whose home contain several butlers,
arrive here for flirtation and observe our
poverty.”</p>

<p>“Mabel Dear I sympathize to you for our
downslide in world. Since marriage to Father
Darling I have expected very little. Before
marriage my home was entirely surrounded by
footmen.”</p>

<p>“Why you no brought 3 or 4 of those here?”
are bright question for me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span></p>

<p>“Eavesdripper! Return to kitchen duty!”
they holla together like chorus girls. Yet I heard
more from other keyholes.</p>

<p>“How I go to Judkins-Perkins dance with
only one dress?” I hear Mabel Dear ask it.</p>

<p>“Are not one dress sifficient for one dance?”
I require silently from myself while refraining
my voice.</p>

<p>“I cannot tell what Father Darling does with
all his money,” dement Hon. Mrs. “He receive
$240. per monthly yet we enjoy less luxury than
the rich. Perhapsly he are gambling in stocks.”</p>

<p>“Result of his selfishness I are the worst
dressed girl in the Curfew Glen Smart Set,” corrods
Hon. Mabel amidst sobs.</p>

<p>“If you had married Father Darling you would
realize why ladies goes on hungry strikes,” snib
Hon. Mrs.</p>

<p>And so onwards.</p>

<p>When Hon. Pratt retreat homewards at night
he usually carry complete bookkeeper library
under his arm so he can spent tired evening finding
who stole that 22c from firm of Obediah
Pennypicker &amp; Co. by which he is owned. Considerable
hours each evening he set to table with
eyeglasses and commonpeople expression on his
face while he read that arithmetic. Pretty soonly
income Hon. Mrs. &amp; Hon. Miss dishguised in
pinksilk Marlborough clothing and intending to
go outwards.</p>

<p>“Such stylish!” report Hon. Father looking
at.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span></p>

<p>“This are not stylish,” renig Hon. Mabel
Dear while spatting her Newport hairs. “This
dress are made from remnant bargains. It are
next to nothing.”</p>

<p>“It seem so at the neck,” ollicute he humoristically.
“Girl wears but little here below but
wears that little long. To what social Durbar
are you going to?”</p>

<p>“The My Cream Tango Tipsickery Circle,”
negotiate Hon. Miss. “O Father Darling, why
you no go long? If oncely you did you might
make less cruel talking.”</p>

<p>“Maybe I shall,” report Hon. Pa laying down
bookkeep volume.</p>

<p>“Father Darling!” hissy Hon. Mrs. “What
you thinking of to say that? You could not go
society as is. The necktie you wear insults our
pride of family.”</p>

<p>“I go where I pleases.” This from him with
glares.</p>

<p>“Why so independence?” She say it.</p>

<p>“Are I not head of this house?” he require.</p>

<p>“Yes, Father Darling,” she file off. “Therefore
it is your duty to stay home and look over
$90. groceries bill.”</p>

<p>She poke forth Hon. Bill and leave husbandly
man to his sorry.</p>

<p>Hon. Mr. Pratt work lonesomely till 9.44
clocktime. Then he fold away books and go to
emotion picture show. At 11.11 clocktime he
come backwards smoking intense cigar. I was
setting on front porch enjoying beauty of moonshin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
amidst Japanese poetry. He observe me
there and donate 1 cigar price 5c while he sat
down next beside me with chumness of college
boy.</p>

<p>“Togo,” he say it at lastly while we make
twin puffs, “are I head of this house or are
not I?”</p>

<p>“Are indeed!” I say kindly because thankful
for cigar.</p>

<p>“Then why should I be battered continuously?”
This from him.</p>

<p>“Heads are always punched,” I define.</p>

<p>“I are breadwinner without being allowed to
keep winnings, I are—.”</p>

<p>“You are an American father,” thusly I report.
“You should learn to be a Japanese
father.”</p>

<p>“How you do it?” he ask with eggerness.</p>

<p>“Japanese father are steam-roller Czar. Wife
are sipposed to approach him with frightened elbows,
daughter must be sipposed to ask for
favors and not get it. All parties, presents, etc.
are given by him. All servants must attend his
selfishness while neglecting females around
house.”</p>

<p>“I shall move to Japan!” he cheer up.</p>

<p>“You needs not,” I snuggest. “I shall be
your Japanese slave and teach you how be
Japanese father. Tomorrow a.m. you can commence
ordering your home around like a floorwalker.
Continually remember inferiorness of
everybody but yourself and feel as sacred as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
possible. Heads shall be chopped for impertinence
to you.”</p>

<p>“I shall enjoy that!” he stotter with smiling
teeth.</p>

<p>At that moments carriage approach upward
through moonlit and Wife &amp; Daughter make
getout.</p>

<p>“You up, Father Darling?” require Hon.
Mrs. with shock tone. “I can smell beer in your
breathing. Man of your aged respectability
should not be boistering at night amidst low-living
friendship.”</p>

<p>She make dragoon expression to me while halling
Father away.</p>

<p>Next morning while it was breakfast Father
Darling sat looking very Cæsar where breakfast
was not cooked while I go through with tray
containing grape-orange, omelit, lady-toast and
slight tea for Hon. Mabel Dear who enjoyed
headache as usual.</p>

<p>“Lay that tray on table befront of me!”
holla Hon. Mr. with commander voice.</p>

<p>“Father Darling!” yellup Hon. Mrs. who was
there, “what you intend do with Mabel Dear’s
headache food?”</p>

<p>“Eat it!” he snarrel while I laid Hon. Tray
befront of him with complete courtesy of Japanese
bows.</p>

<p>“Are it customary for you to be taking comforts
in this house from others?” Eagles spoke
in her tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span></p>

<p>“It are not,” he negotiate with egg spoon, “yet
it shall be from now onwards.”</p>

<p>“Am I to be dishobeyed in home?” she require
shilly.</p>

<p>“Why not?” he ask to know (“Togo, bring
one jar mammalade and considerable more coffee.)
Yes, Mother Love, I have caught commuter
train for 43½ years without breakfast.
Now I am turning over a new sheet. Hereafterly
I shall be Political Boss of my household.
Not only shall I be considered 1st in
serving comfort, but my servants shall be my
complete slavers, similar like they are in Japan.
Are this not so, Togo?”</p>

<p>“Ah yes, exalted-up Sire!” I worship while
bending my base stumach.</p>

<p>“Huh!” snuggest Hon. Mrs. with Huerta expression.
“Togo, go immediately upwards to
Mabel Dear’s room and deliver complete breakfast
to door.”</p>

<p>“Togo,” depose Hon. Mr. looking clamly
cruel, “go immediately upward to Mabel Dear’s
room and make knock-knock to door. When
Mabel Dear answer say so, ‘Your Rev. Father
demand you get upward at oncely and help wash-dish
and other healthful exercise.”</p>

<p>I go. I do so. When Mabel Dear hear
knock-knock she poke forth girlish cap and
decry, “What for, imported heathenish?”</p>

<p>“Your Royal &amp; Exalted Up Hon. Father require
you make immediate get up for wash dish
and be natural like ancestors,” I commit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span></p>

<p>She shreech. Slam door. Downstairs I could
hear similar warcry while sounds of smelling
salts, hysteria, etc. could be heard from dining
room.</p>

<p>Eloping to window I could observe Hon. Mr.
evaporating down path in depot direction.</p>

<p>“Togo!” voice of Mrs. from down there.</p>

<p>I make no correspondence to her tone.</p>

<p>“Togo, will you come downward or shall you
be thrown?”</p>

<p>Still I conceal my words. Ring-ring by telephone
could be distinctually heard.</p>

<p>“Togo,” she say more plaintiffly, “there is
command here by telephone from your Royal
Lordmaster Sir Exalted Pratt.”</p>

<p>“I go downward and obey,” is meakness from
me.</p>

<p>I emerge down there and put that electricity to
my ear.</p>

<p>“Hello!”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
